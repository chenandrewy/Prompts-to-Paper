    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. You and a team are working on a short, quirky academic paper.

    Respond with only latex input (no document environment). Format the math nicely, using align environments when appropriate, but do not define new environments or commands. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

    Respond with only new content. Do not repeat anything in the context.

      consider a simplified barro rietz disaster risk asset pricing model. consumption growth is either 0 or -b is i.i.d. CRRA utility. But here the disaster represents potentially negative effects of an AI explosion (e.g. loss of labor income). derive the expected return of an AI asset that benefits from the explosion: it pays a dividend equal to consumption if there is no disaster, and F times consumption if there is a disaster. Use the fact that the expected return of this asset is equal to the expected return of a one-period version of the asset.

      Make a table illustrating how if F=50, the AI asset can have a very negative expected return. Consider different values of b and gamma. Include b as large as 0.95. Show returns in percent with one decimal place.

      Discuss the following subtleties of the model in standard english (no math):
      
      b should be considered the net result of (1) the AI disaster and (2) the dividend from the AI asset. In other words, the AI asset only partially hedges the disaster, and the key variable in the model is the net effect.
      
      The model assumes that the representative household cannot buy shares of all AI assets. This is consistent with reality, in which many of the most cutting edge AI companies are privately held (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI).

      Though the model is an endowment economy, one can think of the consumption path as the result of a production economy in which the labor share may drop sharply, and the share of output produced by privately-held AI increases sharply.

      While the traditional literature would try to calibrate the model parameters, in this case calibration is completely unreasonable, given the technological singularity.

      Write an introduction for an academic finance paper titled 'Hedging the AI Singularity' based on the following planning documents. 

      Start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. 

      Then describe how technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create.  An example is the current paper, which is entirely written by AI, using a few short prompts. Provide a link to the github site, which is https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/. This differs from say, the internet revolution. AI progress may also be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity).

      Then describe what the paper does. It studies how AI stocks are priced, given that there is the risk that AI will destroy livelihoods andconsumption. 

      Include a footnote noting that "we" refers to one human author and multiple LLMs.

      Cite papers as appropriate. Ensure citations correspond to items from all-bib.

      Write a short, 5 page paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity" based on the following planning and literature documents. 

      Be modest. Do not to over-claim. 

      The abstract should be less than 100 words, not indented. The abstract should mention that the paper is written by AI. Omit the author and date. Include the maketitle command. 

      Make sure all citations match actual papers in the literature documents. 

      Respond with only latex input (no document environment).
