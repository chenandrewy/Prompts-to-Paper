I'll compile a list of research papers from high-quality finance and economics journals on disaster risk and asset prices, with an emphasis on theoretical contributions but including empirical works where relevant. The list will include journal articles from JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA, MS, QJE, JPE, and AER, as well as high-quality working papers from institutions like NBER and AEA. The output will be structured with titles, authors, journal names, years, and abstracts where available. I'll update you when the outline is ready.

# Classic Theoretical Foundations  
- **The Equity Risk Premium: A Solution?** – *Thomas Rietz*. **Journal of Monetary Economics**, 1988. **Summary:** This seminal paper introduced the idea that a **small probability of rare, catastrophic economic disasters** could explain the equity premium puzzle. Rietz showed that if investors perceive a tiny chance of an extreme market crash (e.g. a repeat of the Great Depression), they demand a much higher return on equities relative to safe assets. This **“rare disaster” risk** dramatically raises equity risk premia and can reconcile the observed high equity premium with standard theory ([](https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/7312037c-67b1-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b/content#:~:text=published%20three%20years%20later%20by,to%20think%20differently%2C%20as%20gauged)). *(No formal abstract is available; Rietz’s key insight is that low-probability, high-impact disasters can solve asset-pricing puzzles.)*

- **Rare Disasters and Asset Markets in the Twentieth Century** – *Robert J. Barro*. **Quarterly Journal of Economics**, 2006. **Abstract:** “The potential for rare economic disasters explains a lot of asset-pricing puzzles. I calibrate disaster probabilities from twentieth-century global history, especially the sharp contractions associated with World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. The puzzles that can be explained include the high equity premium, low risk-free rate, and volatile stock returns ([](https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/7312037c-67b1-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b/content#:~:text=The%20potential%20for%20rare%20economic,be%20explained%20include%20the%20high)). Another mystery that may be resolved is why expected real interest rates were low in the United States during major wars, such as World War II… The model…maintains the tractable framework of a representative agent… The results hold with i.i.d. shocks to productivity growth in a Lucas-tree type economy and also with the inclusion of capital formation.” ([](https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/7312037c-67b1-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b/content#:~:text=Depression%2C%20and%20World%20War%20II,be%20explained%20include%20the%20high)) *(Barro provides empirical frequency and size of economic disasters and shows that a disaster probability on the order of 1.5–2% per year with plausible size distribution can quantitatively account for the equity premium and other asset return characteristics.)*

# Theoretical Advances in Disaster Risk Modeling  
- **Variable Rare Disasters: An Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance** – *Xavier Gabaix*. **Quarterly Journal of Economics**, 2012. **Abstract:** “This article incorporates a time-varying severity of disasters into the hypothesis proposed by Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006) that risk premia result from the possibility of rare large disasters. **During a disaster an asset’s fundamental value falls by a time-varying amount.** This in turn generates time-varying risk premia and, thus, volatile asset prices and return predictability ([Variable Rare Disasters: An Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v127y2012i2p645-700.html#:~:text=This%20article%20incorporates%20a%20time,free%20rate%20puzzle%3B%20%28iii)). Using the linearity-generating process, the model is tractable and all prices are solved in closed form. In this framework, **a wide range of asset pricing puzzles can be understood quantitatively** – including the equity premium and risk-free rate puzzles, excess volatility, return predictability, the high price of deep out-of-the-money puts, and more ([Variable Rare Disasters: An Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v127y2012i2p645-700.html#:~:text=framework%2C%20the%20following%20empirical%20regularities,a%20variance%20bound%20test%2C%20as)).” *(Gabaix’s theoretical model with stochastic disaster magnitude offers a unified explanation for many macro-finance anomalies.)*

- **Disaster Risk and Business Cycles** – *François Gourio*. **American Economic Review**, 2012. **Abstract:** “Motivated by the evidence that risk premia are large and countercyclical, this paper studies a tractable real business cycle model with a small risk of economic disaster, such as the Great Depression. **An increase in disaster risk leads to a decline of employment, output, investment, stock prices, and interest rates, and an increase in the expected return on risky assets.** The model matches well data on quantities, asset prices, and particularly the relations between quantities and prices, suggesting that variation in aggregate risk plays a significant role in some business cycles.” ([Disaster Risk and Business Cycles - American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.6.2734#:~:text=Motivated%20by%20the%20evidence%20that,JEL%20E13%2C%20E32%2C%20E44%2C%20G32)) *(This theoretical general equilibrium model shows that time-varying disaster risk can jointly explain macroeconomic fluctuations and countercyclical asset returns.)*

- **Can Time-Varying Risk of Rare Disasters Explain Aggregate Stock Market Volatility?** – *Jessica A. Wachter*. **Journal of Finance**, 2013. **Abstract:** “Why is the equity premium so high, and why are stocks so volatile?… This paper proposes an answer to these questions based on a **time-varying probability of a consumption disaster**. In the model, aggregate consumption follows a normal distribution with low volatility most of the time, but with some probability of a **left-tail “disaster” event**. The possibility of this poor outcome substantially increases the equity premium, while **time-variation in the probability** of this outcome drives high stock market volatility and excess return predictability.” ([Can Time-Varying Risk of Rare Disasters Explain Aggregate Stock Market Volatility? | NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w14386#:~:text=Why%20is%20the%20equity%20premium,volatility%20and%20excess%20return%20predictability)) *(Wachter develops an equilibrium model where changing disaster risk can simultaneously produce a high equity premium and realistic stock market volatility dynamics.)*

# Empirical Evidence and Measurement of Disaster Risk  
- **Disasters Implied by Equity Index Options** – *David Backus, Mikhail Chernov, and Ian Martin*. **Journal of Finance**, 2011. **Abstract:** “We use prices of equity index options to **quantify the impact of extreme events on asset returns**. We define extreme events as departures from normality of the pricing kernel and summarize their impact with high-order cumulants: skewness, kurtosis, and so on. We show that high-order cumulants are quantitatively important in both representative-agent models with disasters and in a statistical pricing model estimated from equity index options. **Option prices thus provide independent confirmation of the impact of extreme events on asset returns,** but they imply a more modest distribution of them.” ([](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15240/w15240.pdf#:~:text=kernel%20and%20summarize%20their%20impact,more%20modest%20distribution%20of%20them)) *(By examining S&P 500 index option prices, the authors infer the probability and impact of rare crashes as perceived by the market. Options data support the rare-disaster hypothesis, while suggesting disaster risk might be somewhat less extreme than calibration of macro data alone.)*

- **Time-Varying Rare Disaster Risk and Stock Returns** – *Henk Berkman, Ben Jacobsen, and John Lee*. **Journal of Financial Economics**, 2011. **Abstract:** “This study provides empirical support for theoretical models that allow for time-varying rare disaster risk. Using a database of 447 international political crises during the period 1918–2006, we create a **crisis index** that shows substantial variation over time. **Changes in this crisis index, our proxy for changes in perceived disaster probability, have a large impact on both the mean and volatility of world stock market returns.** Crisis risk is positively correlated with the earnings–price ratio and the dividend yield. Cross-sectional tests also show that crisis risk is priced: **Industries that are more crisis-risk-sensitive yield higher returns.**” ([Time-varying rare disaster risk and stock returns](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v101y2011i2p313-332.html#:~:text=This%20study%20provides%20empirical%20support,risk%20sensitive%20yield%20higher%20returns)) *(This paper constructs an empirical measure of global “disaster risk” based on geopolitical crises and demonstrates its predictive power for aggregate market returns and its role as a priced risk factor in the cross-section of stock returns.)*

- **Tail Risk and Asset Prices** – *Bryan Kelly and Hao Jiang*. **Review of Financial Studies**, 2014. **Abstract:** “We propose a new measure of time-varying **tail risk** that is directly estimable from the cross section of returns. We exploit firm-level price crashes every month to identify common fluctuations in tail risk across stocks. Our tail measure is significantly correlated with tail risk measures extracted from S&P 500 index options ([](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19375/w19375.pdf#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20new%20measure,power%20for%20aggregate%20market%20returns))… We show that tail risk has strong predictive power for aggregate market returns: A one standard deviation increase in tail risk forecasts an increase in excess market returns of 4.5% over the following year. **Cross-sectionally, stocks with high loadings on past tail risk earn an annual three-factor alpha 5.4% higher** than stocks with low tail risk loadings. These findings are consistent with asset pricing theories that relate equity risk premia to rare disasters or other forms of tail risk.” ([](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19375/w19375.pdf#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20tail%20risk,other%20forms%20of%20tail%20risk)) *(The authors develop an empirical “crash risk” factor by measuring how often individual stocks experience extreme drops. They show that when aggregate tail risk is high, future market returns rise, and that stocks more exposed to tail risk earn higher returns, in line with rare-disaster-based models.)*

- **Crash Sensitivity and the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns** – *Fousseni Chabi-Yo, Stefan Ruenzi, and Florian Weigert*. **Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis**, 2018. **Abstract:** “This article examines whether investors receive compensation for holding crash-sensitive stocks. We capture the **crash sensitivity** of stocks by their lower tail dependence (LTD) with the market… We find that stocks with **strong LTD (high crash sensitivity) have higher average future returns**. This effect cannot be explained by traditional risk factors and is different from the impact of beta, downside beta, coskewness, and cokurtosis. Our findings…support the notion that investors are **crash-averse**.” ([Crash Sensitivity and the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns](https://ideas.repec.org/p/usg/sfwpfi/201324.html#:~:text=This%20paper%20examines%20whether%20investors,averse)) *(Stocks that co-crash with the market (high tail dependence) command a return premium. This empirical cross-sectional evidence reinforces the idea that investors demand extra compensation for exposure to disaster risk.)*

- **Crises and Recoveries in an Empirical Model of Consumption Disasters** – *Emi Nakamura, Jón Steinsson, Robert Barro, José Ursúa*. **American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics**, 2013. **Abstract:** “We estimate an empirical model of **consumption disasters** using new data on consumption for 24 countries over more than 100 years, and study its implications for asset prices. The model allows for partial recoveries after disasters that unfold over multiple years. We find that roughly **half of the drop in consumption due to disasters is subsequently reversed**. Our model generates a sizable equity premium from disaster risk, but one that is substantially smaller than in simpler models. It implies that a large value of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is necessary to explain stock-market crashes at the onset of disasters.” ([Crises and Recoveries in an Empirical Model of Consumption Disasters - American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.5.3.35#:~:text=We%20estimate%20an%20empirical%20model,at%20the%20onset%20of%20disasters)) *(Using a global historical dataset, this paper refines rare-disaster models by allowing for economic recoveries after depressions/wars. The authors show that disaster risk still elevates risk premia, though not as much as models assuming permanent losses, and they discuss conditions required to match observed stock crash sizes.)*

# Recent Extensions and High-Quality Working Papers  
- **Rare Disaster Probability and Options Pricing** – *Robert J. Barro and Gordon Y. Liao*. **Journal of Financial Economics**, 2021 (NBER Working Paper No. 26286). **Abstract:** “We derive an **options-pricing formula** from recursive preferences and estimate rare disaster probability. The new formula applies to far out-of-the-money put options on the stock market when disaster risk dominates, the size distribution of disasters follows a power law, and the representative agent has a CRRA utility. **The formula conforms with options data** on the S&P 500 Index (1983–2018) and analogous international indices. The inferred disaster probability, obtained from monthly fixed effects, is highly correlated across countries, peaks during the 2008–09 crisis, and **forecasts rates of economic growth**.” ([Rare disaster probability and options pricing](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v139y2021i3p750-769.html#:~:text=We%20derive%20an%20options,Crisis%2C%20and%20forecasts%20rates%20of)) *(This work links macro-disaster models with option prices: it provides a tractable formula for the pricing of disaster risk in index options and shows that the market-implied probability of rare crashes moves over time and predicts future growth.)*

- **Rare Disasters, Financial Development, and Sovereign Debt** – *Sergio Rebelo, Neng Wang, and Jinqiang Yang*. **Journal of Finance**, 2022 (NBER Working Paper No. 25031). **Abstract:** “We propose a model of sovereign debt in which countries vary in their level of financial development, defined as the extent to which they can issue debt denominated in domestic currency in international markets. We show that **low levels of financial development generate the “debt intolerance” phenomenon** that plagues emerging markets: it reduces overall debt capacity, increases credit spreads, and limits the country’s ability to smooth consumption.” ([Rare Disasters, Financial Development, and Sovereign Debt | NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25031#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20model%20of,country%27s%20ability%20to%20smooth%20consumption)) *(In this theoretical model, rare macroeconomic disasters interact with financial development – countries with weaker financial systems suffer amplified effects of disaster risk, leading to higher default risk and borrowing costs. This paper extends disaster-risk theory to sovereign debt and international finance.)*

- **Global Disaster Risk Matters** – *Jian Chen, Jiaquan Yao, Qunzi Zhang, Xiaoneng Zhu*. **Management Science**, 2022. **Abstract:** “This article examines the cross-country asset pricing implications of **disaster risk** concerns. We construct a new **disaster risk index**, relying on six news-implied rare disaster proxies (Manela and Moreira 2017), and show that this index is a powerful predictor for stock returns and other asset returns in international markets, both in- and out-of-sample. By further disentangling a global common component from our rare disaster index, we find evidence supporting theories that emphasize **globally shared disaster risk** as an important driving force of asset price fluctuations. Moreover, a return decomposition shows that global disaster risk drives stock returns primarily through the discount rate channel.” ([Global Disaster Risk Matters | Management Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2022.4328#:~:text=This%20article%20examines%20the%20cross,the%20global%20disaster%20risk%20drives)) *(Using text-based measures of disaster concern from news, this paper finds that global disaster risk is an important predictor of international asset returns. The results suggest that investors worldwide price a common component of disaster risk, affecting valuations through expected returns.)*
