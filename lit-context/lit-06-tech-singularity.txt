# Comprehensive List of Works on the Technological Singularity

## Seminal Papers

1. **"The Coming Technological Singularity" (1993)** - Vernor Vinge  
   *Published as an academic paper, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University*  
   This foundational paper argues that humanity is "on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth" and formally introduces the concept of the singularity as a point where "our old models must be discarded and a new reality rules." Vinge suggested this event would occur between 2005 and 2030.

2. **"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine" (1965)** - I.J. Good  
   *Published in Advances in Computers*  
   An early paper proposing that once a machine surpassed human intelligence, it could design even better machines, leading to an "intelligence explosion" with profound implications.

3. **"The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis" (2010)** - David J. Chalmers  
   *Journal of Consciousness Studies*  
   This influential philosophical paper examines what happens when machines become more intelligent than humans, exploring the possibility of an "intelligence explosion" where each generation of intelligent machines creates even more intelligent machines. Chalmers provides rigorous philosophical examination of singularity concepts.

4. **"A History of Transhumanist Thought" (2005)** - Nick Bostrom  
   *Journal of Evolution and Technology*  
   Traces the origins and development of transhumanist ideas, including the concept of technological singularity, and explores how figures like Marvin Minsky, Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil, and Bostrom himself have proposed reasons to take seriously the possibility of human-level artificial intelligence within the first half of the 21st century.

5. **"The Singularity" (2009)** - David J. Chalmers  
   *In Susan Schneider's "Science Fiction and Philosophy: From Time Travel to Superintelligence"*  
   This chapter provides a philosophical discussion of superintelligence that has encouraged philosophers of mind to take transhumanism, mind uploading, and the singularity more seriously, examining questions about uploaded human consciousness and personal identity.

6. **"The Future of Humanity" (2009)** - Nick Bostrom  
   *Academic Paper*  
   Describes four plausible future trajectories for humanity: extinction, recurrent collapse, plateau, and posthumanity. The paper examines various potential futures including technological transcendence.

## Books

7. **"The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology" (2005)** - Ray Kurzweil  
   *Viking Press*  
   Kurzweil's landmark book popularized the concept of the singularity, building on his previous works. He describes his "Law of Accelerating Returns" and predicts that by 2045, technological growth will become so rapid that it represents "a rupture in the fabric of human history."

8. **"The Singularity Is Nearer: When We Merge with AI" (2024)** - Ray Kurzweil  
   *Viking Press*  
   Kurzweil's follow-up to his earlier work, assessing his 1999 prediction that AI will reach human-level intelligence by 2029 and examining exponential technological growth that he believes will "expand human intelligence a millionfold and change human life forever."

9. **"The Age of Spiritual Machines" (1999)** - Ray Kurzweil  
   *Viking Press*  
   A precursor to his later works on the singularity, this book serves as a guide explaining the coming "new age of machines" and what robotic intelligence will mean for life as we know it.

10. **"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies" (2014)** - Nick Bostrom  
    *Oxford University Press*  
    Bostrom presents a detailed exploration of how AI could surpass human intelligence, leading to a 'superintelligence' that could profoundly reshape our world, focusing on both potential benefits and existential risks.

11. **"The Technological Singularity" (2015)** - Murray Shanahan  
    *MIT Press*  
    A concise introduction to the singularity concept, examining both the scientific basis and philosophical implications of a potential intelligence explosion.

12. **"Our Final Invention" (2013)** - James Barrat  
    *St. Martin's Press*  
    A cautionary exploration of advanced AI and the potential risks of superintelligence, with a focus on the existential threats that could arise from unaligned AI.

## Economics Papers

13. **"Scenarios for the Transition to AGI" (2024)** - Anton Korinek & Donghyun Suh  
    *NBER Working Paper*  
    Analyzes how output and wages respond to different AI development scenarios, examining what happens when technological advancement reaches artificial general intelligence (AGI). The authors present two key scenarios: one where human capabilities have no upper bound, and another where human task complexity is limited and full automation becomes possible. Their model shows that if full automation occurs, wages could collapse unless counterbalanced by explosive growth.

14. **"Economic Growth under Transformative AI" (2023)** - Philip Trammell & Anton Korinek  
    *Annual Review of Economics*  
    Provides a comprehensive guide to the wide range of possibilities for output growth, wages, and labor share under scenarios where AI becomes truly transformative for the economy. The authors examine various growth models and their implications for human prosperity.

15. **"Artificial Intelligence and Its Implications for Income Distribution and Unemployment" (2017/2018)** - Anton Korinek & Joseph Stiglitz  
    *NBER Chapter in "The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda"*  
    Examines how AI and worker-replacing technologies affect inequality through two main channels: surplus to innovators and changes in factor prices. The paper includes economic models addressing these effects, even in a "singularity" scenario where machines dominate human labor, and discusses how non-distortionary taxation could compensate potential losers.

16. **"The Rise of Artificially Intelligent Agents" (2019)** - Anton Korinek  
    *Working Paper*  
    Analyzes a future economic landscape where humans and machines interact symmetrically, demonstrating how a "machine singularity" could coexist with human economic stagnation. This paper provides a unique perspective on the potential divergence between machine and human economic trajectories.

17. **"Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth" (2018)** - Philippe Aghion, Benjamin F. Jones & Charles I. Jones  
    *NBER Chapter in "The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda"*
