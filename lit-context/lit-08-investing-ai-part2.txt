# Academic Papers on Investing in AI Stocks and the AI Singularity Risk Hedge

Based on my searches, I've compiled a list of relevant academic papers addressing AI stocks, systemic risk, and the potential relationship to singularity hedging. The papers are organized chronologically, with particular attention to Babina et al.'s work on AI and systemic risk.

## 1. "Artificial Intelligence and Firms' Systematic Risk" (2023)
* **Authors**: Tania Babina, Anastassia Fedyk, Alex Xi He, James Hodson
* **Journal**: SSRN Working Paper
* **Publication Date**: November 2023
* **Publisher**: SSRN
* **Description**: This groundbreaking paper provides direct evidence that firms' investments in AI technologies affect their risk profiles. The authors examine how AI investments impact market beta and systematic risk, with implications for asset pricing, growth options, and cost of capital. While not explicitly mentioning singularity, this paper establishes the fundamental relationship between AI adoption and market risk exposure that underpins the singularity hedge theory.

## 2. "Artificial Intelligence and Systemic Risk" (2022)
* **Authors**: Jon Danielsson, Robert Macrae, Andreas Uthemann
* **Journal**: Journal of Banking and Finance
* **Publisher**: Elsevier
* **Description**: The authors examine how AI is changing the financial system's operations while potentially creating new tail risks. They identify several mechanisms through which AI could destabilize the financial system, including "procyclicality, unknown-unknowns, the need for trust, and optimization against the system." This paper provides theoretical grounding for why AI technology might present unique systemic risks that investors would seek to hedge.

## 3. "Artificial Intelligence, Firm Growth, and Product Innovation" (2023)
* **Authors**: Tania Babina, Anastassia Fedyk, Alex Xi He, James Hodson
* **Journal**: Journal of Financial Economics
* **Publisher**: Elsevier
* **Description**: This study from the Babina research team examines "the use and economic impact of AI technologies" by creating a new measure of firm-level AI investments using employee resumes. While not directly addressing singularity risk, it provides essential context on how AI affects firm growth and innovation, supporting the hypothesis that AI stocks might serve as an economic hedge.

## 4. "AI Ethics and Systemic Risks in Finance" (2021)
* **Authors**: Daliborka Milovanovic (implied)
* **Journal**: Ethics in Science and Environmental Politics
* **Publisher**: NCBI/PubMed
* **Description**: This paper examines the ethical dimensions of AI use in finance, with special attention to systemic risks that "have been neglected so far in professional AI-related codes of conduct, industrial standards and ethical discussions." It offers a theoretical framework based on ethics of complexity, connecting AI ethics to debates on complexity in finance and systemic risks.

## 5. "The Artificial Intelligence Premium" (2024)
* **Authors**: Runfeng Yang, Yufeng Mao, Massimiliano Caporin, Juan-Angel Jiménez-Martin
* **Journal**: SSRN Working Paper
* **Publisher**: SSRN
* **Description**: This study directly examines whether AI adoption is priced in US stocks, finding that "firms with a higher level of adoption of AI exhibit higher stock returns" with "a one-standard deviation increase in the AI adoption level" indicating "an 18 basis-point increase in expected monthly stock returns." The authors explore several economic channels that could explain this premium, including technological adoption risk and market AI attention.

## 6. "An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Regulating Systemic Risk" (2021)
* **Authors**: Multiple authors (names not explicitly stated)
* **Journal**: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence
* **Publisher**: PMC/NIH
* **Description**: This paper applies AI approaches to simulate financial market regulations' impact on systemic risk, addressing how these technologies might help mitigate risks that emerged from the 2007-09 financial crash. It discusses how AI can connect micro and macro-prudential approaches to managing systemic risk.

## 7. "Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning" (2020)
* **Authors**: Shihao Gu, Bryan Kelly, Dacheng Xiu
* **Journal**: Review of Financial Studies
* **Publisher**: Oxford Academic
* **Description**: This influential paper performs "a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums." The authors demonstrate significant economic gains for investors using machine learning forecasts, which helps explain how AI might provide superior risk management in complex market conditions.

## 8. "Artificial Intelligence in Finance: Valuations and Opportunities" (2023)
* **Authors**: Not explicitly stated
* **Journal**: Journal of Multinational Financial Management
* **Publisher**: ScienceDirect
* **Description**: This study examines financial opportunities from AI innovation, presenting "current and projected revenue categorized by sectors" and introducing "a valuation model designed for evaluating AI stocks and ETFs." It analyzes different AI stock indices and their performance relative to existing AI-themed ETFs.

## 9. "Four Singularities for Research" (2024)
* **Authors**: Ethan Mollick
* **Journal**: "One Useful Thing" Newsletter
* **Publisher**: Substack
* **Description**: This piece directly addresses the concept of narrow singularities—"future point[s] in human affairs where AI has so altered a field or industry that we cannot fully imagine what the world on the other side of that singularity looks like." While focusing on academia rather than markets, it provides conceptual frameworks for understanding singularity risks that could apply to investment theories.

## 10. "Unveiling the Influence of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on Financial Markets" (2023)
* **Authors**: Not explicitly stated
* **Journal**: Risks (MDPI)
* **Publisher**: MDPI
* **Description**: This comprehensive analysis employs a mixed-methods approach to examine AI adoption in financial institutions, covering applications like "algorithmic trading, risk management, fraud detection, credit scoring, and customer service." The study identifies key themes including AI adoption trends, regulatory considerations, and ethical implications.

## Discussion of Singularity Implications

While the academic literature doesn't directly address the hypothesis that AI stocks serve as a hedge against AI singularity risk, several papers provide building blocks for this theory. Babina et al.'s work establishes that AI investments affect firm risk profiles, while Danielsson et al. identify mechanisms through which AI might create systemic risks including "unknown-unknowns."

The "AI premium" documented by Yang et al. supports the idea that markets may be pricing in some technological adoption risk associated with AI. When combined with Mollick's conceptual framework of "narrow singularities," these papers collectively suggest that investors might rationally value AI stocks partly as a hedge against unprecedented technological risks.

However, the specific thesis that high AI stock valuations reflect hedging against a "negative AI singularity" remains largely theoretical rather than empirically validated in the academic literature. This appears to be a novel interpretation connecting established research on AI adoption, technological risk premiums, and systemic financial vulnerabilities.
