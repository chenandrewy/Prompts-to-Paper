    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with a simple point: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. 

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

    Respond with only new content. Do not repeat anything in the context.

      Write the model description.

      Two agents:
        - AI owners
          - Can participate in the stock market
          - But they're fully invested in AI so they are not marginal investors in stocks
        - Representative household
          - Marginal investor in stocks: only their consumption matters
          - CRRA utility
      
      C_{t+1}/C_t is i.i.d. and for simplicity is either
        - 1.0 with probability 1-p
        - exp(-b) with probability p
          - Represents an AI disaster: negative effects of an AI explosion for the representative household
          - Includes standard economic losses (e.g. loss of labor income) but also non-standard losses (e.g. loss of way of life, meaning)
          - Benefits from AI in this disaster are largely captured by the AI owners
      Including growth and standard consumption volatility has little effect on asset prices.

      There is a publicly traded AI asset that pays a dividend of
        - 1\% of consumption if there is no disaster
        - 50\% of consumption if there is a disaster
      The model assumes that the representative household cannot buy shares of all AI assets, consistent with reality.

      Derive the main model result.

      Prove the following lemma: The expected return of the AI asset is the same as the expected return of a one-period version of the asset. 

      Using the lemma, derive the expected return of the AI asset.

      Write a quick calibration subsection. Make a table illustrating how the AI asset can have a very negative expected return. Consider values of the disaster probability from 1 percent to 0.01 percent, and consumption loss from 20 percent to 95 percent. Fix risk aversion at 2.  Show returns in percent with one decimal place.

      Write a "Model Discussion" section. Discuss the following subtleties of the model in standard english (no math):

      The model is much simpler than traditional models. One could instead model multiple trees or endogenize consumption (perhaps have the labor share drop sharply) but it's unclear how much value these complications would add. Similarly, a traditional model would incorporate the AI booms and allow for a richer calibration. But given the uncertainty about the AI singularity, it's unclear how much value these complications would add.

      The main point will remain: holding AI assets hedges against a negative AI singularity. The model provides a clear framework for thinking about this economic mechanism.

      A key implication is that the hedging channel only holds if the AI asset is an incomplete hedge. In the model, $b$ is the net effect of the AI disaster and the dividend from the AI asset. If the dividend fully hedges, then $b=0$ and there is no hedging channel.

      Write a short, 10 page paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity." 

      Start with two short background paragraphs. (1) Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. (2) Technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create.  And because AI progress may be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity). An example is the current paper, which is entirely written by AI, using a few short prompts, a feat which was not possible a few months ago. Provide a link to the github site, which is https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/. 

      Then describe what the paper does. It makes the simple point that AI stocks may have high valuations because they hedge against a negative AI singularity. 

      Cite a few closely related papers on AI and asset prices. Then cite a few papers on hedging labor income risk.

      Be concise. Get to the model quickly.

      Be modest. Do not to over-claim. 

      Include the maketitle command but omit the author and date. Then write the abstract, which should be less than 100 words, not indented. The abstract should mention briefly that the writing is generated by AI. 

      In the introduction, include a footnote noting that "we" refers to one human author and multiple LLMs.      

      Make sure all citations match actual papers in the literature documents. 

      Respond with only latex input (no document environment).
