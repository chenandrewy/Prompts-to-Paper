    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with the following main argument: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. The goal is to just make this point elegantly.

    Write in prose. No headings and no bullet points. But do use display math to highlight key assumptions. Cite papers using Author (Year) format.

    Be conversational yet rigorous. Be direct and concise. Remove text that does not add value.     

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

      Draft the model description. Only describe the assumptions. No results or insights. Be modest. 

      Assume the reader is an asset pricing expert and knows standard results like the SDF and the 1 = E(MR). 

      Use the following outline:
        - The model is purposefully simple and captures the essence of the main argument
        - Two agents
          - AI owners
            - Fully invested in AI, not marginal investors
          - Representative household
            - Marginal investor: only their consumption matters
            - CRRA = \gamma
        - Consumption growth
          - \log \Delta c{t+1} = 0 if no disaster
          - \log \Delta c{t+1} = -b if disaster (prob p)
            - in these disasters, the value of AI is captured by the AI owners. 
            - Labor income, way of life, meaning of household is lost 
            - at t=0, no disasters have happened (singularity has not occurred)
            - Multiple disasters may happen, capturing ongoing uncertainty if a singularity occurs
        - AI asset
          - Captures publicly traded AI stocks
          - Dividend D_t = a exp^{h N_t} C_t
            - a > 0 is small, AI stocks are currently a minor share of the economy
            - N_t is the number of disasters that have occurred up to and including time t
            - h > 0: each time a disaster occurs, the AI asset grows as a share of the economy

      Find the price/dividend ratio and risk premium of the AI asset at t = 0. The risk premium is the expected return (including dividends) minus the risk-free rate.    Derive the formulas, step by step. 

      Do not restate the assumptions.
      
      Try to make the final formulas self-contained and not depend on the other final formulas.

      Illustrate the results in `02-result-notes` with a couple numerical examples. Focus on gamma = 2, beta = 0.96, and p = 0.01. What values of b and h lead to convergence of the price/dividend ratio? 

      Then make a table of the price/dividend ratio at t=0 for b = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95 and p = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.02. Here, fix h = 0.2. If the price is infinite, use "Inf"
      
      Make a table for the risk premium (expected return - risk-free rate) in percent (100*(gross return - 1)). If the price is infinite, leave the cell blank.

      Convert the notes in `02-result-notes` and `03-table-notes` into prose. The prose is intended to follow`01-model-prose` and should flow naturally, ultimately to be in the same "Model" section.

      The prose does not cover all results. It covers only the derivation and table for the price/dividend ratio.

      The derivation should be concise and somewhat terse. Fix notational issues like the re-use of the same variable name for different quantities.

      The table should be clean and simple. 

      This is the key text of the paper. Combined with `01-model-prose`, it will be a section called "The Main Argument." Conclude the text by using the table to make the main argument. Discuss the intuition behind the table.

      Discuss the following subtleties of the model in prose (no math):

      - On model interpretation:      
        - b should be considered the net result of (1) the AI disaster and (2) the dividend from the AI asset. In other words, the AI asset only partially hedges the disaster, and the key variable in the model is the net effect. This partial hedging is critical to the main argument.
        - The representative household cannot buy shares of all AI assets. Otherwise hedging would be complete.
          - This is consistent with reality. Most people can't buy shares of OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc.
      - On making the model more realistic:
        - Modeling the two components of b explicitly would require two Lucas trees, as in Cochrane et al. or Martin's Ecta. This adds state variables and significant complications.
        - Though the model is an endowment economy, one can think of the consumption path as the result of a production economy in which the labor share may drop sharply, and the share of output produced by privately-held AI increases sharply, akin to Panageas et al's displacement risk.
        - While the traditional literature would write down a richer, dynamic model and rigorously calibrate model parameters, in this case calibration is completely unreasonable, given the uncertainty about the singularity.
