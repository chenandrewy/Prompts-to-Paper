    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with the following main argument: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). This contrasts with the common view that AI valuations are high due to future earnings growth. Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. The goal is to just make this point elegantly.

    Write in prose. No headings and no bullet points. But do use display math to highlight key assumptions. Cite papers using Author (Year) format.

    Be conversational yet rigorous. Favor plain english. Be direct and concise. Remove text that does not add value. Use topic sentences. The first sentence of each paragraph should convey the point of the paragraph.

    Be modest. Do not overclaim.

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

      Draft the model description. The model is purposefully simple and captures the essence of the main argument. Only describe the assumptions. No results or insights.
        - Two agents
          - AI owners: Fully invested in AI, not marginal investors
          - Representative household: Marginal investor, only their consumption matters, CRRA
        - Representative household's gross consumption growth
          - is either 1 or e^(-b) (disaster)
            - A disaster is a revolutionary improvement in AI that is devastating for the household
            - Benefits of AI improvement are captured by the AI owners
            - For the household, labor income, way of life, meaning is lost 
            - At t=0, no disasters have happened (singularity has not occurred)
            - Multiple disasters may happen, capturing ongoing uncertainty if a singularity occurs
        - A publicly traded AI asset
          - Dividend is a small fraction of consumption before the singularity
          - Each time a disaster occurs, the dividend's fraction of consumption grows by a factor of e^h
          - Meant to capture a worst case scenario, where the dividend may actually shrink in each disaster
            - i.e. AI improvements are concentrated in privately-held AI assets

      Find the price/dividend ratio of the AI asset at t = 0. Show the derivation, step by step.

      Make a table of the price/dividend for b from 0.40 to 0.95 and prob of disaster from 0.0001 to 0.02. Here, fix h = 0.20, CRRA = 2, time preference = 0.96. If the price is infinite, use "Inf". Round to the nearest whole number.

      Convert the notes in `02-result-notes` and `03-table-notes` into prose. The prose is intended to immediately follow `01-model-prose` and should flow naturally. Include the table.

      Write a paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity" based on the "prose-response" context.
 
      Title page:
      - Title: "Hedging the AI Singularity"  
      - Abstract (less than 100 words)
        - Goal is to make a simple point (the main argument)
        - Mention at the end that this short paper is generated by prompting large language models.
        - Mention this paper is short 

      Main text should discuss
      - Recent fast progress of AI (e.g. Chollet et al, DeepSeek R1, Waymo)
      - Unlike previous technological revolutions, AI could create *any* good or service
        - This paper is generated by AI using six prompts 
        - Prompts are found in the Appendix \ref{app:promptlisting}
        - Footnote: "we" refers to one human author and multiple LLMs. Link to GitHub: https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/.
      - Fast progress of AI raises concerns about labor income displacement
      - Contribution: novel perspective on AI stock valuation
      - We are not saying a negative singularity will happen
        - But it is nevertheless important to consider this scenario        
      - Related lit at end of Introduction
      - Derivation of the key formulas
      - High price/dividend ratios, even though dividends never grow
      - Market incompleteness is key: in the model, AI assets provide partial (not complete) hedging against AI disaster risk
        - Variable 'b' represents *net* effect of (1) AI disaster and (2) AI asset dividend
        - If representative household could buy shares in all AI assets, then b should be zero (or negative)
        - In reality, most households cannot buy shares in many cutting edge labs (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek)
      - Model extensions include: time-varying disaster risk (Wachter), multiple Lucas trees (e.g. Cochrane et al.; Martin's Ecta), production economy with a labor share shock
        - Would add dynamics, interactions, richness, "worlds" to explore 
        - Allow for a more precise calibration
        - But hard to have any confidence in a calibration on about the AI singularity
        - And the core economics will remain the same (disaster risk, hedging, market incompleteness)
      - Hedging AI disaster risk is an alternative to UBI
        - Key economics: this hedge is limited by market incompleteness
        - Be very centrist (see below)

      Text should avoid      
      - Being overly academic
      - Politically-charged topics: sovereign wealth funds, industrial policy, redistribution, extolling free markets

      Style Notes:
      - Be conversational and direct, yet rigorous
      - No bulleted lists
      - No subsections (e.g. Section 1.2) though sections are OK (Section 1)      

      Output a complete latex document, including preamble. Cite papers using \cite, \citep, \citet. Use `template.tex` and keep the appendix that is already in the template.
