\section{A Neoclassical Growth Model with Capital Share Disaster Risk}

\subsection{Model Setup}

Consider a standard neoclassical growth model with a representative agent and a Cobb-Douglas production function. The key feature of this model is that the capital share parameter $\alpha$ can suddenly jump to a higher value $\alpha'$ with probability $p$ in each period, representing a "disaster" that shifts income from labor to capital.

The production function is given by:
\begin{equation}
Y_t = A_t K_t^{\alpha_t} L_t^{1-\alpha_t}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Y_t$ is output at time $t$
    \item $A_t$ is total factor productivity
    \item $K_t$ is the capital stock
    \item $L_t$ is labor input (normalized to 1)
    \item $\alpha_t$ is the capital share parameter, which follows:
    \begin{equation}
    \alpha_{t+1} = 
    \begin{cases}
    \alpha' & \text{with probability } p \\
    \alpha & \text{with probability } 1-p
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    where $\alpha' > \alpha$
\end{itemize}

Capital evolves according to:
\begin{equation}
K_{t+1} = (1-\delta)K_t + I_t
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the depreciation rate and $I_t$ is investment.

\subsection{Household Problem}

The representative household maximizes expected lifetime utility:
\begin{equation}
\max E_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t U(C_t)
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the discount factor and $U(C_t)$ is the utility function, which we assume takes the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) form:
\begin{equation}
U(C_t) = \frac{C_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}
\end{equation}
with $\gamma > 0$ being the coefficient of relative risk aversion.

The household's budget constraint is:
\begin{equation}
C_t + I_t = Y_t = r_t K_t + w_t L_t
\end{equation}

where $r_t$ is the rental rate of capital and $w_t$ is the wage rate.

Under competitive markets, factor prices equal their marginal products:
\begin{align}
r_t &= \alpha_t A_t K_t^{\alpha_t-1} L_t^{1-\alpha_t} = \alpha_t \frac{Y_t}{K_t} \\
w_t &= (1-\alpha_t) A_t K_t^{\alpha_t} L_t^{-\alpha_t} = (1-\alpha_t) Y_t
\end{align}

\subsection{Euler Equation and Asset Pricing}

The household's optimization problem yields the standard Euler equation:
\begin{equation}
U'(C_t) = \beta E_t[U'(C_{t+1})R_{t+1}]
\end{equation}

where $R_{t+1}$ is the gross return on capital:
\begin{equation}
R_{t+1} = r_{t+1} + (1-\delta) = \alpha_{t+1} \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)
\end{equation}

The price of capital $P_t$ can be derived from the Euler equation. In equilibrium, the price of a unit of capital should equal the present discounted value of future returns:
\begin{equation}
P_t = E_t \left[ \beta \frac{U'(C_{t+1})}{U'(C_t)} (r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}) \right]
\end{equation}

Substituting the CRRA utility function:
\begin{equation}
P_t = E_t \left[ \beta \left(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\right)^{-\gamma} (r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}) \right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Impact of Capital Share Disaster Risk}

Now, let's analyze how the possibility of a jump in the capital share affects the price of capital. The expected return on capital depends on the realization of $\alpha_{t+1}$:

\begin{align}
E_t[R_{t+1}] &= E_t[\alpha_{t+1} \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)] \\
&= p \cdot \left(\alpha' \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)\right) + (1-p) \cdot \left(\alpha \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)\right) \\
&= \left[p\alpha' + (1-p)\alpha\right] \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t+1}} + (1-\delta)
\end{align}

The key insight is that the expected capital share is $\bar{\alpha} = p\alpha' + (1-p)\alpha$, which is higher than $\alpha$ due to disaster risk.

\subsection{Hedging Motive for Labor Income Risk}

To understand the hedging motive, we need to examine how consumption is affected by a disaster. The household's income consists of:
\begin{align}
Y_t &= r_t K_t + w_t L_t \\
&= \alpha_t \frac{Y_t}{K_t} \cdot K_t + (1-\alpha_t) Y_t \\
&= \alpha_t Y_t + (1-\alpha_t) Y_t \\
&= Y_t
\end{align}

When a disaster occurs, $\alpha_t$ jumps to $\alpha'$, causing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Capital income increases: $r_t K_t$ rises from $\alpha Y_t$ to $\alpha' Y_t$
    \item Labor income decreases: $w_t L_t$ falls from $(1-\alpha) Y_t$ to $(1-\alpha') Y_t$
\end{itemize}

Let's break out this hedging motive more formally. Define the stochastic discount factor (SDF) as:
\begin{equation}
M_{t,t+1} = \beta \frac{U'(C_{t+1})}{U'(C_t)} = \beta \left(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\right)^{-\gamma}
\end{equation}

The covariance between the SDF and the return on capital is crucial for understanding the risk premium:
\begin{equation}
Cov_t(M_{t,t+1}, R_{t+1}) = E_t[M_{t,t+1}R_{t+1}] - E_t[M_{t,t+1}]E_t[R_{t+1}]
\end{equation}

When a disaster occurs, two things happen:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\alpha_t$ increases to $\alpha'$, boosting capital returns $R_{t+1}$
    \item Labor income $(1-\alpha_t)Y_t$ decreases, reducing consumption and increasing the marginal utility of consumption (and thus the SDF)
\end{enumerate}

This creates a positive covariance between the SDF and capital returns, which reduces the risk premium required on capital. In other words, capital serves as a hedge against labor income risk.

To see this mathematically, consider the Euler equation in terms of the risk premium:
\begin{equation}
E_t[R_{t+1}] - R_f = -R_f Cov_t(M_{t,t+1}, R_{t+1})
\end{equation}

where $R_f$ is the risk-free rate.

Since $Cov_t(M_{t,t+1}, R_{t+1}) > 0$ during disasters (both the SDF and capital returns increase), the risk premium on capital is lower than it would be without this hedging benefit.

\subsection{Quantifying the Hedging Value}

To quantify the hedging value, we can decompose the price of capital into two components:
\begin{equation}
P_t = P_t^{risk-neutral} + P_t^{hedging}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{align}
P_t^{risk-neutral} &= E_t \left[ \frac{1}{R_f} (r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}) \right] \\
P_t^{hedging} &= Cov_t \left( M_{t,t+1} - \frac{1}{R_f}, r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1} \right)
\end{align}

The hedging component $P_t^{hedging}$ represents the additional value investors place on capital due to its ability to hedge labor income risk. This component is positive when capital returns are high precisely when consumption is low (i.e., in disaster states).

\subsection{Steady-State Analysis}

In the steady state without disasters, the capital-output ratio is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{K}{Y} = \frac{\alpha}{\frac{1}{\beta} - (1-\delta)}
\end{equation}

With disaster risk, the effective capital share becomes $\bar{\alpha} = p\alpha' + (1-p)\alpha$, leading to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{K}{Y} = \frac{p\alpha' + (1-p)\alpha}{\frac{1}{\beta} - (1-\delta)}
\end{equation}

This shows that disaster risk increases the steady-state capital-output ratio, as households accumulate more capital to hedge against labor income risk.

\section{Conclusion}

In this model, the possibility of a sudden increase in the capital share (a "disaster") creates a hedging motive for holding capital. When the disaster occurs, labor income falls but capital income rises, providing insurance against consumption fluctuations. This hedging benefit increases the price of capital above what would be justified by expected cash flows alone.

The key insight is that capital serves as a natural hedge against shifts in factor shares. This explains why investors might be willing to hold capital even at seemingly low risk premiumsâ€”the insurance value against labor income risk is capitalized into asset prices.

\section{A Neoclassical Growth Model with Stochastic Capital Share}

\subsection{Model Setup}

Consider a neoclassical growth model where the capital share $\alpha$ can suddenly jump to $\alpha'$ with a fixed probability $p$ in each period. The production function follows a Cobb-Douglas form:

\begin{equation}
Y_t = K_t^{\alpha_t} L_t^{1-\alpha_t}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_t \in \{\alpha, \alpha'\}$ is the stochastic capital share with transition probability:

\begin{equation}
\Pr(\alpha_{t+1} = \alpha' | \alpha_t = \alpha) = p
\end{equation}

Once the capital share jumps to $\alpha'$, it remains at that value permanently.

\subsection{Household Problem}

The representative household maximizes expected lifetime utility:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t U(C_t)
\end{equation}

subject to the budget constraint:

\begin{equation}
C_t + I_t = r_t K_t + w_t L_t
\end{equation}

where $C_t$ is consumption, $I_t$ is investment, $r_t$ is the rental rate of capital, and $w_t$ is the wage rate. Capital evolves according to:

\begin{equation}
K_{t+1} = (1-\delta)K_t + I_t
\end{equation}

where $\delta$ is the depreciation rate.

\subsection{Factor Prices}

Factor prices are determined by their marginal products:

\begin{align}
r_t &= \alpha_t K_t^{\alpha_t-1} L_t^{1-\alpha_t} \\
w_t &= (1-\alpha_t) K_t^{\alpha_t} L_t^{-\alpha_t}
\end{align}

\subsection{Euler Equation and Asset Pricing}

The household's Euler equation is:

\begin{equation}
U'(C_t) = \beta \mathbb{E}_t[U'(C_{t+1})(1-\delta+r_{t+1})]
\end{equation}

This can be rewritten to determine the price of capital $P_t^K$:

\begin{equation}
P_t^K = \mathbb{E}_t\left[\frac{\beta U'(C_{t+1})}{U'(C_t)}(r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K)\right]
\end{equation}

To characterize the hedging value of capital, we need to expand this expression by conditioning on the possible states of $\alpha_{t+1}$.

\subsection{Characterizing the Hedging Value}

Let's denote the stochastic discount factor as $M_{t,t+1} = \frac{\beta U'(C_{t+1})}{U'(C_t)}$. The price of capital can be written as:

\begin{align}
P_t^K &= (1-p)\mathbb{E}_t[M_{t,t+1}(r_{t+1}(\alpha) + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K(\alpha)) | \alpha_{t+1}=\alpha] \\
&+ p\mathbb{E}_t[M_{t,t+1}(r_{t+1}(\alpha') + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K(\alpha')) | \alpha_{t+1}=\alpha']
\end{align}

To highlight the hedging value, we express consumption in terms of wage income and capital income:

\begin{equation}
C_t = w_t L_t + r_t K_t - I_t = (1-\alpha_t)Y_t + \alpha_t Y_t - I_t = Y_t - I_t
\end{equation}

When $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha'$ (assuming $\alpha' > \alpha$), the share of output going to labor $(1-\alpha_t)$ decreases, reducing wage income. However, the share going to capital increases, potentially providing a hedge against this labor income loss.

\subsection{Decomposing the Hedging Value}

To explicitly characterize the hedging value, we can take a first-order approximation of the stochastic discount factor around the steady state and decompose the covariance terms:

\begin{align}
P_t^K &\approx \mathbb{E}_t[M_{t,t+1}]\mathbb{E}_t[r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K] + \text{Cov}_t(M_{t,t+1}, r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K)
\end{align}

The covariance term captures the hedging value. To see this more clearly, we can further decompose it:

\begin{align}
\text{Cov}_t(M_{t,t+1}, r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K) &= \text{Cov}_t\left(\frac{\beta U'(C_{t+1})}{U'(C_t)}, r_{t+1} + (1-\delta)P_{t+1}^K\right)
\end{align}

When $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha'$, labor income $(1-\alpha_t)Y_t$ decreases while capital income $\alpha_t Y_t$ increases. If the utility function exhibits sufficient risk aversion, the marginal utility $U'(C_{t+1})$ increases when consumption falls due to the labor income shock. Simultaneously, the return on capital $r_{t+1}$ increases due to the higher capital share.

This creates a positive covariance between the stochastic discount factor and capital returns, resulting in a hedging premium that reduces the price of capital relative to its expected payoff.

\subsection{Quantifying the Hedging Value}

To quantify this hedging value, we can express the wage in the state where $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha'$:

\begin{equation}
w_{t+1}(\alpha') = (1-\alpha')K_{t+1}^{\alpha'}L_{t+1}^{-\alpha'}
\end{equation}

Compared to the wage if $\alpha$ had remained unchanged:

\begin{equation}
w_{t+1}(\alpha) = (1-\alpha)K_{t+1}^{\alpha}L_{t+1}^{-\alpha}
\end{equation}

The percentage loss in labor income due to the jump in capital share is approximately:

\begin{equation}
\frac{w_{t+1}(\alpha) - w_{t+1}(\alpha')}{w_{t+1}(\alpha)} \approx \frac{\alpha' - \alpha}{1-\alpha} + (\alpha' - \alpha)\ln\left(\frac{K_{t+1}}{L_{t+1}}\right)
\end{equation}

This expression shows that the labor income loss depends on both the magnitude of the capital share jump $(\alpha' - \alpha)$ and the capital-labor ratio. The hedging value of capital is higher when this potential labor income loss is larger.

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this neoclassical growth model with a stochastic capital share, capital serves as a hedge against labor income risk. When the capital share jumps, the resulting decrease in labor income is partially offset by the increase in capital income. This hedging property affects the price of capital through the covariance between the stochastic discount factor and capital returns.

The magnitude of this hedging value depends on several factors:
1. The size of the potential jump in capital share $(\alpha' - \alpha)$
2. The probability of the jump $(p)$
3. The capital-labor ratio $(K/L)$
4. The degree of risk aversion in the utility function

This analysis highlights how technological changes that alter factor shares can have significant implications for asset pricing and portfolio choice, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding how investors might hedge against labor income risks through capital investments.

\section{Hedging Value in Terms of Future Wages}

To characterize the hedging value in terms of future wages, we need to express consumption in terms of wages and other components of the budget constraint. Let's proceed step by step.

\subsection{Budget Constraint and Consumption}

The household's budget constraint can be written as:
\begin{align}
c_t + k_{t+1} = w_t + (1-\delta+r_t)k_t
\end{align}
where $c_t$ is consumption, $k_t$ is capital, $w_t$ is the wage, $r_t$ is the return on capital, and $\delta$ is the depreciation rate.

Iterating this budget constraint forward and imposing the transversality condition, we can express current consumption in terms of present and future wages and current capital:
\begin{align}
c_t = w_t + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{w_{t+j}}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}-\delta)} + (1-\delta+r_t)k_t - \lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{k_{t+T+1}}{\prod_{i=0}^{T}(1+r_{t+i}-\delta)}
\end{align}

Assuming the transversality condition holds, the last term disappears, giving:
\begin{align}
c_t = w_t + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{w_{t+j}}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}-\delta)} + (1-\delta+r_t)k_t
\end{align}

\subsection{Impact of Capital Share Shift on Wages}

When $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, the labor share $(1-\alpha)$ drops to nearly zero. This has profound implications for wages.

In a Cobb-Douglas production function $Y_t = K_t^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$, the wage is:
\begin{align}
w_t = (1-\alpha)\frac{Y_t}{L_t}
\end{align}

If $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, then $(1-\alpha^\prime) \approx 0$, causing wages to collapse to nearly zero. Future wages $w_{t+j}$ would also approach zero after the regime shift.

\subsection{Hedging Value Expression}

The marginal utility of consumption depends on these future wages. Let's denote the state where $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha^\prime$ as state $s'$ and the state where it remains at $\alpha$ as state $s$.

The hedging value can be expressed as the covariance between the stochastic discount factor and the return on capital:
\begin{align}
\text{Hedging Value} = -\text{Cov}\left(M_{t,t+1}, R_{t+1}\right)
\end{align}

Where $M_{t,t+1}$ is the stochastic discount factor and $R_{t+1}$ is the return on capital.

Expanding this in terms of our two possible states:
\begin{align}
\text{Hedging Value} = -p\left(M_{t,t+1}(s') - E[M_{t,t+1}]\right)\left(R_{t+1}(s') - E[R_{t+1}]\right)
\end{align}

When $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, the stochastic discount factor in state $s'$ will be extremely high due to the collapse in wages and hence consumption. Simultaneously, the return on capital $R_{t+1}(s')$ will be extremely high as capital captures nearly all output.

\subsection{Human Capital Valuation}

The present value of human capital (PVHC) can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
\text{PVHC}_t = w_t + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}E_t\left[\frac{w_{t+j}}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}-\delta)}\right]
\end{align}

When there's a probability $p$ of $\alpha$ jumping to $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, the expected present value becomes:
\begin{align}
\text{PVHC}_t &= w_t + (1-p)\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}E_t\left[\frac{w_{t+j}(s)}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}(s)-\delta)}\right] + p\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}E_t\left[\frac{w_{t+j}(s')}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}(s')-\delta)}\right]\\
&\approx w_t + (1-p)\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}E_t\left[\frac{w_{t+j}(s)}{\prod_{i=1}^{j}(1+r_{t+i}(s)-\delta)}\right]
\end{align}

The second term in the last line approaches zero because $w_{t+j}(s') \approx 0$ when $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$.

\subsection{Optimal Portfolio Choice}

The optimal portfolio choice will involve a significant hedging demand for assets that pay off well when $\alpha$ jumps to $\alpha^\prime$. Such assets would provide insurance against the catastrophic decline in labor income.

The hedging demand can be quantified as:
\begin{align}
\theta_H = \frac{\gamma \cdot \text{Cov}(R_{t+1}, \log(w_{t+1}/w_t))}{\sigma^2_R}
\end{align}

Where $\gamma$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion, $R_{t+1}$ is the return on the hedging asset, and $\sigma^2_R$ is its variance.

When $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, this covariance becomes strongly negative, creating a large positive hedging demand for capital assets that benefit from the regime shift.

\subsection{Practical Implications}

In the extreme case where $\alpha^\prime \approx 1.0$, the hedging value of capital becomes paramount. This scenario resembles concerns about technological unemployment from advanced AI, where capital (including AI systems) could theoretically capture nearly all economic output.

Individuals would optimally hold significant capital assets as insurance against this scenario, even if these assets offer lower expected returns in normal times. This provides a rational explanation for why investors might accept seemingly low risk premiums on AI-related investments.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has emerged as one of the most significant economic developments of the 21st century. Recent breakthroughs in large language models, computer vision, and reinforcement learning have dramatically expanded the scope of tasks that can be automated, raising concerns about the potential displacement of human labor across various sectors \citep{acemoglu2020}. As AI systems become increasingly capable of performing complex cognitive tasks once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, investors face growing uncertainty about the future value of their human capital and labor income streams \citep{garleanu2012, kogan2020}.

Technological change has been a constant feature of economic history, from the Industrial Revolution to the digital transformation of recent decades. However, AI represents a fundamentally different kind of technological shift. Unlike previous innovations that automated specific physical tasks or enhanced particular industries, AI has the potential to impact virtually every sector of the economy simultaneously \citep{babina2024}. The internet revolution, for instance, primarily transformed information access and communication channels \citep{ofek2003, hong2006}, but still required extensive human involvement to create content and services. In contrast, there is theoretically no product or service that sufficiently advanced AI could not, in principle, create or deliver \citep{chen2024}. This universality of AI's potential application distinguishes it from previous technological revolutions.

Moreover, some researchers and technologists have proposed the possibility of an "AI singularity"â€”a hypothetical point at which AI systems become capable of recursive self-improvement, potentially leading to an intelligence explosion and rapid, discontinuous technological change \citep{gofman2024}. While the timing and likelihood of such an event remain subjects of debate, the possibility introduces a unique form of tail risk for labor markets and asset prices \citep{rietz1988, barro2006}. This risk is characterized not just by the magnitude of potential disruption but also by the suddenness with which it might occur.

This paper examines the financial implications of AI-induced labor displacement by modeling the AI singularity as a potential sudden shock to the capital share of income. We develop a neoclassical growth model in which the capital share parameter $\alpha$ may jump to a significantly higher value $\alpha'$ with a fixed probability $p$, representing the arrival of transformative AI technology that substantially increases the returns to capital relative to labor. This approach builds on the disaster risk literature \citep{gourio2013, wachter2013} but focuses specifically on the redistribution of income from labor to capital rather than aggregate output declines.

We characterize the price of capital in this environment using the Euler equation and derive explicit expressions for the risk premium associated with AI singularity risk. Crucially, we decompose this premium to isolate the hedging value of capital against the potential loss of labor income. This analysis reveals how forward-looking investors might optimally adjust their portfolios to hedge against the possibility of AI-induced wage displacement.

Our work contributes to several strands of literature. First, we extend the disaster risk framework \citep{rietz1988, barro2006, gourio2012} to model technological disruption rather than traditional macroeconomic disasters. Second, we build on studies of labor income risk and portfolio choice \citep{cocco2005, benzoni2007, eiling2013} by examining how AI-specific labor market risks might affect optimal investment strategies. Finally, we complement emerging empirical work on AI's impact on firm valuations and stock returns \citep{babina2024, cao2024, eisfeldt2023} by providing a theoretical framework for understanding how AI progress might reshape asset prices and risk premia.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical model of AI singularity risk. Section 3 derives the asset pricing implications and characterizes the hedging value of capital against labor income loss. Section 4 examines the extreme case where $\alpha'$ approaches 1, representing near-complete automation. Section 5 discusses empirical implications and potential tests of our theory. Section 6 concludes.

### **Literature Review Outline: Hedging AI-Induced Labor Displacement through Stock Investing**  

#### **1. Introduction**  
- **Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020)** – Empirical evidence that automation reduces employment and wages, demonstrating the risk of labor displacement.  

#### **2. Theoretical Perspectives on AI, Labor Displacement, and Asset Prices**  
- **Gârleanu, Kogan, & Panageas (2012)** – Theoretical model showing how technological progress creates displacement risk, which affects asset pricing by making stocks of innovative firms serve as hedges.  
- **Kogan, Papanikolaou, & Stoffman (2020)** – General equilibrium model linking creative destruction to value–growth return spreads, showing that firms exposed to displacement risk require higher returns.  
- **Chen & Wang (2024)** – Task-based AI framework distinguishing labor-augmenting vs. labor-replacing innovations and their distinct effects on firm valuation.  

#### **3. Empirical Evidence on AI, Labor Displacement, and Stock Returns**  
- **Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020)** – Empirical evidence that industrial robots reduce labor demand, showing economic risks from automation.  
- **Kogan, Papanikolaou, et al. (2023–2025)** – Measures firm-level displacement risk from competitors’ AI-driven innovations and finds that higher displacement risk predicts higher stock returns.  
- **Eisfeldt, Schubert, & Zhang (2023)** – Event study on ChatGPT’s release; finds that stocks of AI-exposed firms significantly outperformed human-labor-reliant firms, supporting AI’s role in stock returns.  
- **Chen & Wang (2024)** – Uses AI-related patents to measure the stock market’s response to different types of AI innovation, confirming that both augmenting and displacing AI raise firm value.  

#### **4. Implications for Investors**  
- **Gârleanu, Kogan, & Panageas (2012)** – Theoretical insight that AI-driven firms act as a hedge but may offer lower long-run risk premia.  
- **Eisfeldt, Schubert, & Zhang (2023)** – Empirical evidence supporting AI-exposed stock portfolios as a hedge, particularly in response to major AI advances.  
- **Kogan, Papanikolaou, et al. (2023–2025)** – Shows that displacement risk is priced in stocks, meaning investors can construct portfolios that hedge against labor income losses.  
- **Chen & Wang (2024)** – Practical insight that AI exposure in stocks should be balanced within a diversified portfolio, as labor-complementing AI may also play a role in stock performance.  

This outline provides a structured approach to the literature review, where each bullet represents a key paper contributing to the discussion on AI, labor displacement, and stock market hedging strategies.

Here’s an outline version of the literature review, with each bullet representing a key paper and sub-bullets summarizing its contributions.  

---

## **Literature Review Outline: Hedging Labor Income Risk Through Stock Investing**  

### **1. Theoretical Frameworks: Labor Income Risk in Portfolio Choice**  
- **Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Develops a life-cycle portfolio choice model incorporating uninsurable labor income risk.  
  - Finds that if labor income is bond-like (low correlation with stocks), younger investors should hold more equities.  
  - Suggests that labor income risk has significant implications for retirement planning.  

- **Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2007) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Models labor income and stock dividends as **cointegrated** (sharing a long-run trend).  
  - Predicts that young investors with stock-like labor income might optimally avoid or even short stocks.  
  - Provides a rationale for observed hump-shaped stock allocations over the life cycle.  

- **Jagannathan and Wang (1996) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Extends the CAPM to include human capital as part of the market portfolio.  
  - Shows that incorporating labor income risk improves the model’s explanatory power for asset returns.  

- **Santos and Veronesi (2006) – *Review of Financial Studies***  
  - Proposes that fluctuations in labor income relative to consumption help predict equity risk premia.  
  - Highlights the macroeconomic link between labor market conditions and stock returns.  

- **Eiling (2013) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Develops an **industry-specific** human capital model.  
  - Finds that labor income risk varies across industries and influences expected stock returns.  
  - Stocks in industries with high labor income volatility earn a return premium due to investor hedging demands.  

---

### **2. Empirical Evidence: Household Portfolio Choices and Earnings Risk**  
- **Heaton and Lucas (2000) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Examines U.S. household portfolio data.  
  - Finds **little evidence** that wage income volatility affects stock allocation.  
  - Suggests that entrepreneurial risk (owning a private business) is a much stronger determinant of stock investment.  

- **Guiso, Jappelli, and Terlizzese (1996) – *American Economic Review***  
  - Uses Italian survey data to show that workers with higher expected wage volatility hold fewer stocks.  
  - Provides early empirical support for the idea that labor risk crowds out financial risk-taking.  

- **Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) – *International Economic Review***  
  - Finds that higher income volatility reduces stock market participation rates.  
  - Suggests that labor income risk interacts with fixed costs of investing in stocks, creating a **barrier to entry**.  

- **Betermier et al. (2012) – *Journal of Financial Economics***  
  - Uses Swedish panel data to track **how investors adjust their portfolios when they change jobs or industries**.  
  - Shows that moving from a stable to a risky industry leads to a significant reduction in stock allocation.  
  - Confirms the **hedging motive** by controlling for individual fixed effects.  

---

### **3. Industry- and Occupation-Specific Risk Hedging**  
- **Massa and Simonov (2006) – *Review of Financial Studies***  
  - Finds that many investors overweight their own industry’s stocks, contradicting hedging theory.  
  - Suggests this behavior is driven by **familiarity bias** rather than rational hedging.  
  - Notes that financially sophisticated investors are less likely to make this mistake.  

- **Bodie, Detemple, and Rindisbacher (2009) – *Journal of Finance***  
  - Examines how business cycle sensitivity affects stock investment decisions.  
  - Shows that workers in **cyclical industries** hold fewer equities, particularly in cyclical sectors.  
  - Supports the idea that workers hedge by avoiding stocks correlated with their labor income.  

- **Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) – *Review of Financial Studies***  
  - Shows that **human capital returns are negatively correlated with stock returns** at an aggregate level.  
  - Suggests that “good news on Wall Street” is often “bad news on Main Street.”  
  - Provides an asset pricing perspective on why labor income risk influences stock market equilibrium.  

---

### **4. Conclusion and Implications**  
- **Key takeaway:** Labor income risk is a major determinant of optimal stock investment, influencing both individual portfolio decisions and asset pricing.  
- **Practical implications:**  
  - Individuals should **adjust stock exposure based on the riskiness of their job**.  
  - Those with stable jobs (e.g., government workers) can afford higher equity exposure.  
  - Workers in **highly cyclical** industries should hold a more conservative, diversified portfolio.  
  - Holding **own-industry or employer stock** is risky and often contradicts optimal hedging principles.  
- **Broader impact:**  
  - Labor income risk affects **stock market participation rates**, contributing to wealth inequality.  
  - Target-date funds and standard life-cycle models may not be **personalized enough** to account for industry-specific labor risks.  
  - Future research could explore **behavioral frictions** that prevent optimal hedging.

Got it. I'll gather research papers from top-tier finance journals (JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA, MS) on investing in AI stocks, ensuring at least 50% are from the last five years and at least 50% specifically focus on AI (with the remainder covering broader tech investing). I'll include both empirical and theoretical studies, with abstracts and citations for reference.

I'll let you know when I have the results.

## **1. Artificial Intelligence, Firm Growth, and Product Innovation**  
**Authors:** Tania Babina, Anastassia Fedyk, Alex He, James Hodson  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2024  
**Abstract:** *“We study the use and economic impact of AI technologies. We propose a new measure of firm-level AI investments using employee resumes. Our measure reveals a stark increase in AI investments across sectors. AI-investing firms experience higher growth in sales, employment, and market valuations. This growth comes primarily through increased product innovation. Our results are robust to instrumenting AI investments using firms’ exposure to universities’ supply of AI graduates. AI-powered growth concentrates among larger firms and is associated with higher industry concentration. Our results highlight that new technologies like AI can contribute to growth and superstar firms through product innovation.”* ([Artificial intelligence, firm growth, and product innovation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v151y2024ics0304405x2300185x.html#:~:text=We%20study%20the%20use%20and,growth%20and%20superstar%20firms%20through))

## **2. From Man vs. Machine to Man + Machine: The Art and AI of Stock Analyses**  
**Authors:** Sean Cao, Wei Jiang, Junbo Wang, Baozhong Yang  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2024  
**Abstract:** *“An AI analyst trained to digest corporate disclosures, industry trends, and macroeconomic indicators surpasses most analysts in stock return predictions. Nevertheless, humans win “Man vs. Machine” when institutional knowledge is crucial, e.g., involving intangible assets and financial distress. AI wins when information is transparent but voluminous. Humans provide significant incremental value in “Man + Machine”, which also substantially reduces extreme errors. Analysts catch up with machines after “alternative data” become available if their employers build AI capabilities. Documented synergies between humans and machines inform how humans can leverage their advantage for better adaptation to the growing AI prowess.”* ([From Man vs. Machine to Man + Machine: The art and AI of stock analyses](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v160y2024ics0304405x24001338.html#:~:text=An%20AI%20analyst%20trained%20to,leverage%20their%20advantage%20for%20better))

**Abstract:** *“We document an unprecedented brain drain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) professors from universities from 2004 to 2018. We find that students from the affected universities establish fewer AI startups and raise less funding. The brain‐drain effect is significant for tenured professors, professors from top universities, and deep-learning professors. Additional evidence suggests that unobserved city‐ and university‐level shocks are unlikely to drive our results. We consider several economic channels for the findings. The most consistent explanation is that professors’ departures reduce startup founders’ AI knowledge, which we find is an important factor for successful startup formation and fundraising.”* ([Artificial Intelligence, Education, and Entrepreneurship](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v79y2024i1p631-667.html#:~:text=We%20document%20an%20unprecedented%20brain,factor%20for%20successful%20startup%20formation))

## **4. Man versus Machine Learning: The Term Structure of Earnings Expectations and Conditional Biases**  
**Authors:** Jules H. van Binsbergen, Xiao Han, Alejandro Lopez-Lira  
**Journal:** *The Review of Financial Studies*  
**Year:** 2023  
**Abstract:** *“We introduce a real-time measure of conditional biases to firms’ earnings forecasts. The measure is defined as the difference between analysts’ expectations and a statistically optimal unbiased machine-learning benchmark. Analysts’ conditional expectations are, on average, biased upward, a bias that increases in the forecast horizon. These biases are associated with negative cross-sectional return predictability, and the short legs of many anomalies contain firms with excessively optimistic earnings forecasts. Further, managers of companies with the greatest upward-biased earnings forecasts are more likely to issue stocks. Commonly used linear earnings models do not work out-of-sample and are inferior to those analysts provide.”* ([Man versus Machine Learning: The Term Structure of Earnings Expectations and Conditional Biases](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/rfinst/v36y2023i6p2361-2396..html#:~:text=We%20introduce%20a%20real,sample))

## **5. Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning**  
**Authors:** Shihao Gu, Bryan Kelly, Dacheng Xiu  
**Journal:** *The Review of Financial Studies*  
**Year:** 2020  
**Abstract:** *“We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.”* ([Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/rfinst/v33y2020i5p2223-2273..html#:~:text=We%20perform%20a%20comparative%20analysis,an%20Internet%20Appendix%2C%20which%20is))

## **6. Active Technological Similarity and Mutual Fund Performance**  
**Authors:** Ping McLemore, Richard Sias, Chi Wan, H. Zafer Yüksel  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*  
**Year:** 2022  
**Abstract:** *“We examine whether superior understanding of technological innovation is a source of mutual fund managers’ ability to garner positive abnormal returns. Consistent with our hypothesis, the inter-quintile annual net Carhart alpha spread for mutual funds sorted on changes in the technological similarity (TS) of their portfolio holdings is 282 basis points. Moreover, because changes in TS are largely orthogonal to other predictors of mutual fund success (e.g., industry concentration, active share, fund R², and lag fund alpha), changes in TS can be combined with other measures to help identify the best performing funds.”* ([Active Technological Similarity and Mutual Fund Performance | Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/active-technological-similarity-and-mutual-fund-performance/054A8C9D6D464125296588B0214F3125#:~:text=We%20examine%20whether%20superior%20understanding,identify%20the%20best%20performing%20funds))

## **7. DotCom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices**  
**Authors:** Eli Ofek, Matthew Richardson  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2003  
**Abstract:** *“This paper explores a model based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs facing short sales restrictions, and its explanation for the rise, persistence, and eventual fall of Internet stock prices. First, we document substantial short sale restrictions for Internet stocks. Second, using data on Internet holdings and block trades, we show a link between heterogeneity and price effects for Internet stocks. Third, arguing that lockup expirations are a loosening of the short sale constraint, we document average, long‐run excess returns as low as –33 percent for Internet stocks post‐lockup. We link the Internet bubble burst to the unprecedented level of lockup expirations and insider selling.”* ([DotCom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v58y2003i3p1113-1137.html#:~:text=This%20paper%20explores%20a%20model,lockup%20expirations%20and%20insider%20selling))

## **8. Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles**  
**Authors:** Harrison Hong, José Scheinkman, Wei Xiong  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2006  
**Abstract:** *“We model the relationship between asset float (tradeable shares) and speculative bubbles. Investors with heterogeneous beliefs and short‐sales constraints trade a stock with limited float because of insider lockups. A bubble arises as price overweighs optimists’ beliefs and investors anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher valuations. The bubble’s size depends on float as investors anticipate an increase in float with lockup expirations and speculate over the degree of insider selling. Consistent with the Internet experience, the bubble, turnover, and volatility decrease with float and prices drop on the lockup expiration date.”* ([Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v61y2006i3p1073-1117.html#:~:text=We%20model%20the%20relationship%20between,and%20prices%20drop%20on%20the))

## **9. Inexperienced Investors and Bubbles**  
**Authors:** Robin Greenwood, Stefan Nagel  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2009  
**Abstract:** *“We use mutual fund manager data from the technology bubble to examine the hypothesis that inexperienced investors play a role in the formation of asset price bubbles. Using age as a proxy for managers’ investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets. The economic significance of young managers’ actions is amplified by large inflows into their funds prior to the peak in technology stock prices.”* ([Inexperienced investors and bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v93y2009i2p239-258.html#:~:text=We%20use%20mutual%20fund%20manager,investors%20in%20experimental%20asset%20markets)) ([Inexperienced investors and bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v93y2009i2p239-258.html#:~:text=inflows%20into%20their%20funds%20prior,peak%20in%20technology%20stock%20prices))

## **10. Who Drove and Burst the Tech Bubble?**  
**Authors:** John M. Griffin, Jeffrey H. Harris, Tao Shu, Selim Topaloglu  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2011  
**Abstract:** *From 1997 to March 2000, as technology stocks rose more than five-fold, institutional investors bought more new technology stock supply than individual investors. Among institutions, hedge funds were the most aggressive buyers, while independent investment advisors and mutual funds contributed the most capital flow into tech stocks ([Style ISP](http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/JFIA/Vol%2012_2_1.pdf#:~:text=investment%20environment,as%20technology%20stocks%20rose%20more)). Notably, hedge funds did not exert a correcting force on prices during the bubble, consistent with models in which rational investors choose to ride bubbles. When the bubble began to burst in March 2000, the reversal was marked by a broad sell-off from institutional investors but **accelerated buying by individuals**, particularly retail clients of discount brokers ([Style ISP](http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/JFIA/Vol%2012_2_1.pdf#:~:text=%28i,off%20from)). This evidence suggests that institutions helped drive the late-1990s tech bubble on the way up, and individual investors were left buying as prices collapsed.*
