    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with the following main argument: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. The goal is to just make this point elegantly.

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

    Respond with only new content. Do not repeat anything in the context.

      consider a simplified barro rietz disaster risk asset pricing model. \delta_{t+1} = 1 w/ prob p (i.i.d.) indicates a disaster in period t. If \delta_{t+1} = 1, \log \Delta c_{t+1} = -b. Otherwise \log \Delta c_{t+1} = 0.  Consider a "Perp" asset that can be bought at t=0. The dividend in t = 1, 2, 3,..., D_{t} is C_{t} if \delta_1 = 0 (no disaster), and F times C_{t} if \delta_1=1. Note that the split in D_t is not recursive, it's like a one time deal. Buying Perp in t > 0 just gives you a standard perpetuity (scaled depending on \delta_1). Find the price and expected return of this asset.

      Now consider a PerpAR asset, where AR stands for almost recursive. Like Perp, it pays D_{t+1} = C_{t+1} if \delta_1, \delta_2,...,\delta_t = 0.  But the first time a disaster hits, say at time = j, then the Perp pays D_t = F C_j for all t >= j.

      Write a "Main Argument" section based on the `01-model` and `02-calibration` context inputs. 

      The section should be brief and not have any subsections nor bullet points. The math should be self-contained but concise and elegant. I repeat: no bullet points. 

      Cover the following points:
      - The model is purposefully simple and designed to capture the essence of the main argument.
      - There are two agents
        - AI owners
          - Fully invested in AI, so are not marginal investors in stocks
        - Representative household
          - Marginal investor in stocks: only their consumption matters
      - The key assumptions are the consumption growth and for the representative household and dividend process for the publically traded AI asset. 
        - Show these using display math. 
        - Describe and motivate. 
          - AI disasters is the negative effects of an AI explosion for the representative household
          - Benefits from AI in this disaster are largely captured by the AI owners
          - Representative household cannot fully hedge because in this disaster, the AI assets that take off are private.
      - State general claims about the model first (proving with concise arguments). Then state the key formulas and how they are derived.
      - Interpret the expected return result in terms of the main argument.
      - Show and discuss the table from `02-calibration` .
      - Explain how adding more realism (standard consumption risk, Barro disasters like financial crises, possibility of huge gains in the AI asset, etc.) would not change the main argument.
