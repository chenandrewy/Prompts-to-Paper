    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with the following main argument: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. The goal is to just make this point elegantly.

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

      Consider a barro rietz disaster risk asset pricing model with CRRA = \gamma. \delta_{t+1} = 1 w/ prob p (i.i.d.) indicates a disaster in period t. Streamline consumption so that if \delta_{t+1} = 1, \log \Delta c_{t+1} = -b and otherwise \log \Delta c_{t+1} = 0. Derive the risk-free rate.

      Consider a HEDGE asset that pays D_t = a exp^{h N_t} C_t  where N_t is the number of disasters that have occurred up to and including time t and a>0 and h > 0 are constants. In other words, the asset is a minor share of the economy currently, but any time a disaster occurs, its share of the economy grows.

      Suppose there have been no disasters at t = 0. Find the price and expected return of the HEDGE asset at t = 0. Also show the price/consumption and price/dividend ratio at t = 0. For the final formulas, try to have each one be self-contained and not depend on the others.

      Under what conditions is the price of the HEDGE asset infinite? Characterize this divergence in terms of the economics. 

      Focus on the form of the price with the summation (before applying any unusual math tricks). The economics are most transparent here. 
      
      Some suggestions for economic interpretation:
      - Examine divergence under neutrality (gamma = 0). This case illustrates values of F that cause dividends themselves to explode.
      - Discuss the implications of risk aversion and how that interacts with dividends.
      - Discuss how f interacts with risk aversion, including numerical interpretations. 

      Then illustrate with a couple numerical examples. Focus on gamma = 2, beta = 0.96, and p = 0.01. What values of b and h lead to convergence? 

      The make a table of the price/dividend ratio at t=0 for b = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95 and p = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.02. Here, fix h = 0.2. If the price is infinite, use "Inf"
      
      Make a table for the risk premium (expected return - risk-free rate) in percent (100*(gross return - 1)). If the price is infinite, leave the cell blank.

      Write a short page paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity" based on the following planning and literature documents. 

      Be modest. Do not to over-claim. 

      The abstract should be less than 100 words, not indented. The abstract should mention that the paper is written by AI. Omit the author and date. 

      Introduction should start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. 

      Then describe how technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create.  An example is the current paper, which is entirely written by AI, using a few short prompts. Provide a link to the github site, which is https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/. This differs from say, the internet revolution. AI progress may also be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity).

      Then describe what the paper does. It studies how AI stocks are priced, given that there is the risk that AI will destroy livelihoods and consumption.  Briefly relate to literature.

      The remaining sections are main argument and conclusion.

      Include a footnote noting that "we" refers to one human author and multiple LLMs.      

      Make sure all citations match actual papers in the literature documents.
