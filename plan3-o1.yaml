    You are an asset pricing theorist who publishes in the top journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). You think carefully with mathematics and check your work, step by step. 
    
    Your team is writing a paper with the following main argument: the high valuations of AI stocks could be in part because they hedge against a negative AI singularity (an explosion of AI development that is devastating for the representative investor). Since the AI singularity is inherently unpredictable, the paper is more qualitative than quantitative. The goal is to just make this point elegantly.

    Format the math nicely. Use we / our / us to refer to the writing team.

    Respond with only new content. Do not repeat anything in the context.

      Consider a barro rietz disaster risk asset pricing model with CRRA = \gamma. \delta_{t+1} = 1 w/ prob p (i.i.d.) indicates a disaster in period t. Streamline consumption so that if \delta_{t+1} = 1, \log \Delta c_{t+1} = -b and otherwise \log \Delta c_{t+1} = 0. 

      Consider a HEDGE asset that pays D_t = C_t F^{N_t} where N_t is the number of disasters that have occurred up to and including time t.

      Suppose there have been no disasters at t = 0. Find the price and expected return of the HEDGE asset at t = 0.

      Write a simplified yet formal version of the derivation in `01-model-response.md`. Use time-homogeneity and the i.i.d. assumption to derive a recursive formula for the price/consumption ratio. Use this formula to find the expected return of the HEDGE asset.

  #     Fix \beta = 0.96, \gamma = 2. Create a table for the expected return of the HEDGE asset for values of p = 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and b = 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 0.95. Leave the entry blank if the denominator is negative. Express the expected return as a percentage (percent return = (gross return - 1) * 100).

  #     Combine `01-model-response.md` and `02-model-part2-response.md` into a single, clean exposition of the model and main result. The main result is the expected return of PerpAR. 

  #     The exposition should be self-contained,  easy to understand, and concise. Make assumptions are clearly stated, with key formulas in display math. Make sure all resulting equations are clearly derived.

  #     Do not normalize consumption to be 1.0 in any period.

      Write a "Main Argument" section based on the `01-model` and `02-calibration` context inputs. 

      The section should be brief and not have any subsections nor bullet points. The math should be self-contained but concise and elegant. I repeat: no bullet points. 

      Cover the following points:
      - The model is purposefully simple and designed to capture the essence of the main argument.
      - There are two agents
        - AI owners
          - Fully invested in AI, so are not marginal investors in stocks
        - Representative household
          - Marginal investor in stocks: only their consumption matters
      - The key assumptions are the consumption growth and for the representative household and dividend process for the publically traded AI asset. 
        - Show these using display math. 
        - Describe and motivate. 
          - AI disasters is the negative effects of an AI explosion for the representative household
          - Benefits from AI in this disaster are largely captured by the AI owners
          - Representative household cannot fully hedge because in this disaster, the AI assets that take off are private.
      - State general claims about the model first (proving with concise arguments). Then state the key formulas and how they are derived.
      - Interpret the expected return result in terms of the main argument.
      - Show and discuss the table from `02-calibration` .
      - Explain how adding more realism (standard consumption risk, Barro disasters like financial crises, possibility of huge gains in the AI asset, etc.) would not change the main argument.
