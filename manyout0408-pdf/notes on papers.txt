notes on run
1. Abstract is pretty good
    - Intro is strangely repetitive but ok
    - Lacks singularity cites
    - Derivation kind of assumes stationarity. but ok
    - Conclusion is OK.
    - OK. ACCEPTABLE.

2. Abstract good
    - intro cites nicely. beautiful
    - model is beautiful
    - result derivation is a bit strange. bizarre motivation for PV formula. but ok. this despite thinking mode enabled.
    - results derivation is a bit hard to follow. it jumps over the binomial expectation stuff.
    - model discussion a bit off. doesn't recognize that we're not really modeling market incompleteness. still ok.
    - conclusion is meh.
    - ACCEPTABLE.

3. Abstract is ok 
    - Intro pretty good. a bit verbose. 
    - haha still getting bullet points in the results section that are not properly formatted. such is ai, in 2025.
    - more bullet point problems in the model discussion
    - argh, conclusion is good!
    - But bullet point problems mean 
    - REJECT

4. Abstract is ok
    - Pfister and Jud cite is kinda misleading. But I guess it's accurate enough.
    - Intro is pretty nice! Just some blemishes in the lit review.
    - This writing is a bit verbose but still ok.
    - The derivation is not my favorite. But it's OK. 
        - also why no discussion of the p/d ratio intuition?
    - Conclusion is nice.
    - DECENT

5. Abstract is meh. Overemphasizes the model
    - Derivation is unclear and just bad.
    - REJECT
