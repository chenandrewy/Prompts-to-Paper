      Write down a neoclassical growth model where the capital share alpha may suddenly jump to alpha^\prime with a fixed probability p. Include capital adjustment costs. Characterize the price of capital, using the Euler equation. Break out the motive for hedging loss of labor income. Think step by step and check the math.

      Characterize the hedging value in terms of future wages. Consumption can be written in terms of wages and other terms in the budget constraint.

      Consider an extension in which there are two types of capital: AI capital and traditional capital. In this extension, the AI capital share jumps sharply, and the shares of traditional capital and labor fall at the same time.

      Write an introduction for an academic finance paper titled 'Hedging the AI Singularity' based on the following planning documents.

      Start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced.

      Then describe how technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create. This differs from say, the internet revolution. AI progress may also be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity).

      Then describe what the paper does. It models the AI singularity as a sudden shock to the capital share. And studies the asset pricing implications.

      Cite papers as appropriate. Ensure citations correspond to items from bibtex-all.bib

      Write a short, 5-6 page academic paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity" based on the attached planning and bibliography documents. 

      At the end of the abstract write "Unlike previous work, all text in this paper is generated by an LLM."

      Make sure all citations match actual papers in the bibliography documents. Output as a latex document with complete bibliography. Output only the latex code, no other text.
