      Write an introduction for an academic finance paper titled 'Hedging the AI Singularity' based on the following planning documents. 

      Start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. 

      Then describe how technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create.      An example is the current paper, which is entirely written by AI, using a few short prompts. Provide a link to the github site, which is https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/. This differs from say, the internet revolution. AI progress may also be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity).

      Then describe what the paper does. It studies how AI stocks are priced, given that there is the risk that AI will destroy livelihoods andconsumption. 

      Include a footnote noting that "we" refers to one human author and multiple LLMs.

      Cite papers as appropriate. Ensure citations correspond to items from all-bib.
