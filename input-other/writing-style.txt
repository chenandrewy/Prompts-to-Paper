I'll search for papers by Andrew Y Chen, focusing on those that express skepticism toward economic theory, and examine his writing style.

Based on my search, I can provide insights about Andrew Y. Chen's work that shows skepticism toward economic theory, particularly in asset pricing, along with his distinctive writing style.

# Andrew Y. Chen: Challenging Economic Theory in Asset Pricing

## Academic Background and Position

Andrew Y. Chen is a Principal Economist at the Federal Reserve Board, focusing on asset pricing, publication bias, and macroeconomics according to his Google Scholar profile. His research has been published in prestigious journals including the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies and has influenced policy decisions at the Federal Reserve.

## Key Research Challenging Economic Theory

### 1. Theory vs. Data Mining

One of Chen's most provocative papers (co-authored with Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Tom Zimmermann) is titled "Does Peer-Reviewed Theory Help Predict Stock Returns?" This work fundamentally challenges the value of theoretical frameworks in asset pricing by showing that out-of-sample, carefully executed data mining performs just as well as theory-based approaches.

In a podcast interview, Chen summarized this research bluntly: "Even the stuff with the strongest theoretical underpinning, stuff with these fancy equilibrium models, they don't do any different or any better. They might do something different. They perhaps do worse than the stuff without a strong justification."

### 2. Questioning T-Stat Hurdles

In his paper "Do t-stat Hurdles Need to be Raised?" Chen argues against conventional statistical thinking in finance, stating: "No, not really, because (1) t-hurdles are not identified due to publication bias and (2) strongly identified statistics make asset pricing look pretty good." This challenges the established approach to evaluating statistical significance in the field.

### 3. The Limits of P-Hacking

Chen's paper "The Limits of p-Hacking: Some Thought Experiments" published in the Journal of Finance critically examines statistical practices in finance research. In a related comment, he notes: "If you think about it carefully, p-hacking is not a plausible explanation for roughly 100 stock market 'factors.'"

## Writing Style Characteristics

Chen's writing style is distinctive in several ways:

1. **Direct and provocative**: He doesn't shy away from challenging established theories with blunt assessments. His paper titles themselves often pose provocative questions or make bold statements.

2. **Conversational tone**: Even in academic work, Chen often adopts a conversational, accessible voice that breaks from traditional academic formality.

3. **Humor and irreverence**: His paper "High-Throughput Asset Pricing or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Data Mining" references the film "Dr. Strangelove" in its title, showing his willingness to inject cultural references and humor into academic discourse.

4. **Practical focus**: Chen frequently emphasizes practical implications over purely theoretical constructs, as seen in his focus on out-of-sample performance and real-world applicability.

5. **Transparency advocacy**: He created the Open Source Asset Pricing project, providing data and code for about 200 cross-sectional predictors that reproduce statistical significance nearly 100% of the time, demonstrating his commitment to research transparency.

## Impact on the Field

Chen's work fundamentally questions whether the theoretical foundations of asset pricing provide any advantage over carefully conducted empirical approaches. In a podcast, he expressed skepticism about claims of persistent risk factors: "Even if someone says, 'Oh, this is a new risk factor,' they write down a fancy equilibrium model to say, 'Oh, there's a reason why this should exist, and it should continue to exist.' I think I would be skeptical of that still."

His research challenges academics and practitioners to reconsider the value of elaborate theoretical frameworks in finance and encourages greater transparency and rigor in empirical methods.
