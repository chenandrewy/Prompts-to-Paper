Got it. I'll gather research papers from top-tier finance journals (JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA, MS) on investing in AI stocks, ensuring at least 50% are from the last five years and at least 50% specifically focus on AI (with the remainder covering broader tech investing). I'll include both empirical and theoretical studies, with abstracts and citations for reference.

I'll let you know when I have the results.

## **1. Artificial Intelligence, Firm Growth, and Product Innovation**  
**Authors:** Tania Babina, Anastassia Fedyk, Alex He, James Hodson  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2024  
**Abstract:** *“We study the use and economic impact of AI technologies. We propose a new measure of firm-level AI investments using employee resumes. Our measure reveals a stark increase in AI investments across sectors. AI-investing firms experience higher growth in sales, employment, and market valuations. This growth comes primarily through increased product innovation. Our results are robust to instrumenting AI investments using firms’ exposure to universities’ supply of AI graduates. AI-powered growth concentrates among larger firms and is associated with higher industry concentration. Our results highlight that new technologies like AI can contribute to growth and superstar firms through product innovation.”* ([Artificial intelligence, firm growth, and product innovation](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v151y2024ics0304405x2300185x.html#:~:text=We%20study%20the%20use%20and,growth%20and%20superstar%20firms%20through))

## **2. From Man vs. Machine to Man + Machine: The Art and AI of Stock Analyses**  
**Authors:** Sean Cao, Wei Jiang, Junbo Wang, Baozhong Yang  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2024  
**Abstract:** *“An AI analyst trained to digest corporate disclosures, industry trends, and macroeconomic indicators surpasses most analysts in stock return predictions. Nevertheless, humans win “Man vs. Machine” when institutional knowledge is crucial, e.g., involving intangible assets and financial distress. AI wins when information is transparent but voluminous. Humans provide significant incremental value in “Man + Machine”, which also substantially reduces extreme errors. Analysts catch up with machines after “alternative data” become available if their employers build AI capabilities. Documented synergies between humans and machines inform how humans can leverage their advantage for better adaptation to the growing AI prowess.”* ([From Man vs. Machine to Man + Machine: The art and AI of stock analyses](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v160y2024ics0304405x24001338.html#:~:text=An%20AI%20analyst%20trained%20to,leverage%20their%20advantage%20for%20better))

## **3. Artificial Intelligence, Education, and Entrepreneurship**  
**Authors:** Michael Gofman, Zhao Jin  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2024  
**Abstract:** *“We document an unprecedented brain drain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) professors from universities from 2004 to 2018. We find that students from the affected universities establish fewer AI startups and raise less funding. The brain‐drain effect is significant for tenured professors, professors from top universities, and deep-learning professors. Additional evidence suggests that unobserved city‐ and university‐level shocks are unlikely to drive our results. We consider several economic channels for the findings. The most consistent explanation is that professors’ departures reduce startup founders’ AI knowledge, which we find is an important factor for successful startup formation and fundraising.”* ([Artificial Intelligence, Education, and Entrepreneurship](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v79y2024i1p631-667.html#:~:text=We%20document%20an%20unprecedented%20brain,factor%20for%20successful%20startup%20formation))

## **4. Man versus Machine Learning: The Term Structure of Earnings Expectations and Conditional Biases**  
**Authors:** Jules H. van Binsbergen, Xiao Han, Alejandro Lopez-Lira  
**Journal:** *The Review of Financial Studies*  
**Year:** 2023  
**Abstract:** *“We introduce a real-time measure of conditional biases to firms’ earnings forecasts. The measure is defined as the difference between analysts’ expectations and a statistically optimal unbiased machine-learning benchmark. Analysts’ conditional expectations are, on average, biased upward, a bias that increases in the forecast horizon. These biases are associated with negative cross-sectional return predictability, and the short legs of many anomalies contain firms with excessively optimistic earnings forecasts. Further, managers of companies with the greatest upward-biased earnings forecasts are more likely to issue stocks. Commonly used linear earnings models do not work out-of-sample and are inferior to those analysts provide.”* ([Man versus Machine Learning: The Term Structure of Earnings Expectations and Conditional Biases](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/rfinst/v36y2023i6p2361-2396..html#:~:text=We%20introduce%20a%20real,sample))

## **5. Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning**  
**Authors:** Shihao Gu, Bryan Kelly, Dacheng Xiu  
**Journal:** *The Review of Financial Studies*  
**Year:** 2020  
**Abstract:** *“We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.”* ([Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning](https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/rfinst/v33y2020i5p2223-2273..html#:~:text=We%20perform%20a%20comparative%20analysis,an%20Internet%20Appendix%2C%20which%20is))

## **6. Active Technological Similarity and Mutual Fund Performance**  
**Authors:** Ping McLemore, Richard Sias, Chi Wan, H. Zafer Yüksel  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*  
**Year:** 2022  
**Abstract:** *“We examine whether superior understanding of technological innovation is a source of mutual fund managers’ ability to garner positive abnormal returns. Consistent with our hypothesis, the inter-quintile annual net Carhart alpha spread for mutual funds sorted on changes in the technological similarity (TS) of their portfolio holdings is 282 basis points. Moreover, because changes in TS are largely orthogonal to other predictors of mutual fund success (e.g., industry concentration, active share, fund R², and lag fund alpha), changes in TS can be combined with other measures to help identify the best performing funds.”* ([Active Technological Similarity and Mutual Fund Performance | Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/active-technological-similarity-and-mutual-fund-performance/054A8C9D6D464125296588B0214F3125#:~:text=We%20examine%20whether%20superior%20understanding,identify%20the%20best%20performing%20funds))

## **7. DotCom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices**  
**Authors:** Eli Ofek, Matthew Richardson  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2003  
**Abstract:** *“This paper explores a model based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs facing short sales restrictions, and its explanation for the rise, persistence, and eventual fall of Internet stock prices. First, we document substantial short sale restrictions for Internet stocks. Second, using data on Internet holdings and block trades, we show a link between heterogeneity and price effects for Internet stocks. Third, arguing that lockup expirations are a loosening of the short sale constraint, we document average, long‐run excess returns as low as –33 percent for Internet stocks post‐lockup. We link the Internet bubble burst to the unprecedented level of lockup expirations and insider selling.”* ([DotCom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v58y2003i3p1113-1137.html#:~:text=This%20paper%20explores%20a%20model,lockup%20expirations%20and%20insider%20selling))

## **8. Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles**  
**Authors:** Harrison Hong, José Scheinkman, Wei Xiong  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2006  
**Abstract:** *“We model the relationship between asset float (tradeable shares) and speculative bubbles. Investors with heterogeneous beliefs and short‐sales constraints trade a stock with limited float because of insider lockups. A bubble arises as price overweighs optimists’ beliefs and investors anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher valuations. The bubble’s size depends on float as investors anticipate an increase in float with lockup expirations and speculate over the degree of insider selling. Consistent with the Internet experience, the bubble, turnover, and volatility decrease with float and prices drop on the lockup expiration date.”* ([Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v61y2006i3p1073-1117.html#:~:text=We%20model%20the%20relationship%20between,and%20prices%20drop%20on%20the))

## **9. Inexperienced Investors and Bubbles**  
**Authors:** Robin Greenwood, Stefan Nagel  
**Journal:** *Journal of Financial Economics*  
**Year:** 2009  
**Abstract:** *“We use mutual fund manager data from the technology bubble to examine the hypothesis that inexperienced investors play a role in the formation of asset price bubbles. Using age as a proxy for managers’ investment experience, we find that around the peak of the technology bubble, mutual funds run by younger managers are more heavily invested in technology stocks, relative to their style benchmarks, than their older colleagues. Furthermore, young managers, but not old managers, exhibit trend-chasing behavior in their technology stock investments. As a result, young managers increase their technology holdings during the run-up, and decrease them during the downturn. Both results are in line with the behavior of inexperienced investors in experimental asset markets. The economic significance of young managers’ actions is amplified by large inflows into their funds prior to the peak in technology stock prices.”* ([Inexperienced investors and bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v93y2009i2p239-258.html#:~:text=We%20use%20mutual%20fund%20manager,investors%20in%20experimental%20asset%20markets)) ([Inexperienced investors and bubbles](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v93y2009i2p239-258.html#:~:text=inflows%20into%20their%20funds%20prior,peak%20in%20technology%20stock%20prices))

## **10. Who Drove and Burst the Tech Bubble?**  
**Authors:** John M. Griffin, Jeffrey H. Harris, Tao Shu, Selim Topaloglu  
**Journal:** *Journal of Finance*  
**Year:** 2011  
**Abstract:** *From 1997 to March 2000, as technology stocks rose more than five-fold, institutional investors bought more new technology stock supply than individual investors. Among institutions, hedge funds were the most aggressive buyers, while independent investment advisors and mutual funds contributed the most capital flow into tech stocks ([Style ISP](http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/JFIA/Vol%2012_2_1.pdf#:~:text=investment%20environment,as%20technology%20stocks%20rose%20more)). Notably, hedge funds did not exert a correcting force on prices during the bubble, consistent with models in which rational investors choose to ride bubbles. When the bubble began to burst in March 2000, the reversal was marked by a broad sell-off from institutional investors but **accelerated buying by individuals**, particularly retail clients of discount brokers ([Style ISP](http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/JFIA/Vol%2012_2_1.pdf#:~:text=%28i,off%20from)). This evidence suggests that institutions helped drive the late-1990s tech bubble on the way up, and individual investors were left buying as prices collapsed.*
