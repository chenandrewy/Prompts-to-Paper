Write a short, roughly 10 page academic paper titled "Hedging the AI Singularity" based on the following planning and literature documents. 

Be modest. Do not to over-claim. 

The abstract should be less than 100 words, not indented. Author is Andrew Y. Chen from the Fed Board. The views are his own. The abstract should mention that the paper is written by AI.

Include a footnote in the introduction noting that "we" in this paper refers to one human author and multiple LLMs.

In the introduction, give as an example the current paper, which is entirely written by AI, using 6 short prompts, and a selection process for selecting the best paper out of 100. Provide a link to the github site, which is https://github.com/chenandrewy/Prompts-to-Paper/.  Discuss similarities with leading submissions to the ARC-AGI competition that generate thousands of Python programs and selecting the best ones.

Make sure all citations match actual papers in the literature documents. Output as a latex document with complete literature. Output only the latex code, no other text. The latex code is intended for compiling, assuming that lit-99-bibtex.bib is in the relative path ../input-other/.

Use 1 in margins, 12 pt font, 1.5 line spacing. Omit the date.
