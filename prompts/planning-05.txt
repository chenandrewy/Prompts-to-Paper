Write an introduction for an academic finance paper titled 'Hedging the AI Singularity' based on the following planning documents. 

Start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. 

Then describe how technological change has occurred before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create. 

Then describe what the paper does. It models the AI singularity as a sudden shock to the capital share. And studies the asset pricing implications. 

Cite papers as appropriate. Ensure citations correspond to items from all-bib. Be careful to only cite papers if they are justified by the text.
