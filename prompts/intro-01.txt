Write an introduction for an academic finance paper titled 'Hedging the AI Singularity' based on the following planning documents. 

Start with background. Describe how AI progress is happening quickly, and investors may be concerned about their wages being displaced. 

Then describe how technological change has occured before, but AI is distinct because there is no product or service that AI could not, in principal create. This differs from say, the internet revolution. AI progres may also be incredibly sudden (the AI singularity).

Then describe what the paper does. It models the AI singularity as a sudden shock to the capital share.

For now, do not cite any literature. We'll add that later.

Output as a latex input (no document environment).
