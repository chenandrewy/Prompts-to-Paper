Here is the reorganized outline, where each item corresponds to a **single paper**, with the **authors, publication year, and journal** included.

# **Outline: Asset Prices and Disaster Risk**  

## **1. Introduction**  
   - **Rietz, Richard (1988, *Journal of Monetary Economics*)**: Introduced the **rare disaster hypothesis** to explain the **Equity Premium Puzzle** by incorporating a small probability of a large economic collapse.  
   - **Gourio, François (2013, *American Economic Review*)**: Extended rare disaster models to **corporate credit risk** and macroeconomic fluctuations, linking disaster risk to firms' investment and borrowing decisions.  

---

## **2. Theoretical Foundations of Disaster Risk in Asset Pricing**  

### **2.1 Rare Disaster Hypothesis and the Equity Premium Puzzle**  
   - **Rietz, Richard (1988, *Journal of Monetary Economics*)**: Proposed that even a small probability of a catastrophic event can generate a **high equity premium** and a **low risk-free rate**.  
   - **Barro, Robert (2006, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)**: Provided empirical support for rare disasters using historical consumption drops across multiple countries, estimating disaster probability and size.  

### **2.2 Alternative Explanations in Asset Pricing**  
   - **Mehra, Rajnish & Edward Prescott (1985, *Journal of Monetary Economics*)**: Identified the **Equity Premium Puzzle**, arguing that standard consumption-based models cannot explain observed asset returns.  
   - **Campbell, John & John Cochrane (1999, *Journal of Political Economy*)**: Developed a **habit formation** model to generate high risk premia without assuming extreme disaster risk.  
   - **Bansal, Ravi & Amir Yaron (2004, *Journal of Finance*)**: Proposed the **long-run risk model**, where persistent uncertainty about long-term growth explains high asset returns.

## **3. Extensions: Time-Varying and Endogenous Disaster Risk**  

### **3.1 Time-Varying Disaster Probability**  
   - **Wachter, Jessica (2013, *Journal of Finance*)**: Developed an asset pricing model where the **probability of a rare disaster is stochastic**, explaining **market volatility and valuation changes**.  
   - **Gourio, François (2012, *American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics*)**: Integrated **time-varying disaster risk** into a macroeconomic model, showing how fluctuations in disaster probability impact economic activity and asset prices.  

### **3.2 Time-Varying Disaster Severity**  
   - **Gabaix, Xavier (2012, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)**: Allowed both the probability and **size of disasters** to vary over time, explaining **return predictability, stock volatility, and bond premia**.  

### **3.3 Endogenous Disaster Risk and Corporate Finance**  
   - **Gourio, François (2013, *American Economic Review*)**: Incorporated disaster risk into a **production economy**, explaining how firms’ investment and financing decisions react to changes in disaster expectations.

## **4. Empirical Developments and Testing Disaster Risk Models**  

### **4.1 Historical Validation of Disaster Risk**  
   - **Barro, Robert & José Ursúa (2008, *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity*)**: Compiled a dataset of macroeconomic disasters, finding that historical evidence supports the **rare disaster hypothesis**.  
   - **Nakamura, Emi, Jón Steinsson, Robert Barro & José Ursúa (2013, *American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics*)**: Showed that disasters unfold over multiple years rather than as instantaneous collapses, refining disaster calibration methods.  

### **4.2 Market-Implied Evidence of Disaster Risk**  
   - **Backus, David, Mikhail Chernov & Ian Martin (2011, *Journal of Finance*)**: Used **option prices** to estimate the market’s implied probability of rare disasters, finding strong support for **tail risk pricing**.  
   - **Gourio, François (2012, *American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics*)**: Estimated **time-varying disaster probability** from stock valuations and risk premia, showing that perceived disaster risk fluctuates over time.  

### **4.3 Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing and Disaster Risk**  
   - **Kelly, Bryan & Hao Jiang (2014, *Journal of Finance*)**: Found that **stocks with high tail risk exposure** earn higher expected returns, confirming disaster risk as a **priced factor**.  

### **4.4 Bond Yields and the Term Structure**  
   - **Gabaix, Xavier (2012, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)**: Modeled disaster risk in bond pricing, explaining **low risk-free rates** and the **upward-sloping yield curve**.  

### **4.5 Credit Spreads and Disaster Risk Premium**  
   - **Gourio, François (2013, *American Economic Review*)**: Showed that corporate bond spreads contain a significant **disaster risk premium**, explaining the **credit spread puzzle**.

## **5. Disaster Risk in Different Asset Classes**  

### **5.1 Equities and Stock Market Volatility**  
   - **Wachter, Jessica (2013, *Journal of Finance*)**: Demonstrated how **stochastic disaster probability** explains equity market swings, crashes, and recoveries.  

### **5.2 Government and Corporate Bonds**  
   - **Gourio, François (2013, *American Economic Review*)**: Explained why corporate bond spreads **widen in downturns**, even when default probabilities remain low.  
   - **Barro, Robert (2006, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)**: Argued that disaster risk explains **persistently low Treasury bond yields**.  

### **5.3 Options and Tail Hedging Strategies**  
   - **Gabaix, Xavier (2012, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)**: Modeled why deep out-of-the-money **put options are expensive**, reflecting the cost of insuring against rare disasters.  

### **5.4 Foreign Exchange Markets and Currency Risk**  
   - **Farhi, Emmanuel & Xavier Gabaix (2016, *Review of Economic Studies*)**: Developed a **rare disaster model for currency markets**, explaining the **forward premium puzzle** and safe-haven demand.  

### **5.5 Commodities and Real Assets**  
   - **Kelly, Bryan & Hao Jiang (2014, *Journal of Finance*)**: Applied the **disaster risk factor** to commodities, finding that tail risk impacts **futures pricing**.
